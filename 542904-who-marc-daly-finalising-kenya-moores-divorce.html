Due to recent and ongoing circumstances, I can no longer continue in the marriage. My sole concern and focus is and will always be my daughter, Brooklyn, my miracle baby. She was made in love and steadfast commitment. I ask that our privacy be respected moving forward.<p class=align-left>The separation was prompted by a fight at a charity event hosted by Daly. Kenya suspected Daly of being in an inappropriate relationship with another lady and had seen some communication between them.</p><p class=align-left>Interestingly, Marc and Kenya tried to work things out before finalising their divorce.
