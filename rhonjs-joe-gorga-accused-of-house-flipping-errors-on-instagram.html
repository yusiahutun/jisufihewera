House flipping is&nbsp;when<strong> </strong>a real estate investor buys houses and sells them for profit. For a house to be considered a ‘flip’, it must be bought with the intention to quickly resell.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> put its investigation hat on and alleged there were errors in some of Gorga’s posts.</p><p>On January 11th, Joe posted a photo of a modern and stylish kitchen he captioned: “Another flip. This house sold for 759,000.00 #growwithgorga.”</p><p>However, Page Six alleges the same image was posted on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Design Depot’s</a> Instagram more than four years ago. It says the image was taken by photographer Nadav Havakook and Page Six spoke to him about the photo. Havakook told the publication:</p><p>[Joe] definitely did not have permission to use my images.

Let’s just say he wasn’t too impressed by the revelation.</p><p>Levy claimed Gorga had nothing to do with the project, including any part of the construction or design process. Levy told Page Six:</p><p>I personally designed that kitchen myself and everything else in the house for one of our clients – who is a developer – and he sold that house for, I believe, $1.5 million, so there’s no way that house sold for $759,000.</p>Ethan Levy, Page Six<p>Of course Twitter had to get involved to poke fun at the claims:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I worked with Joe Gorga flipping house.

In response, Svensson told the publication:</p><p>It’s clearly my house, I messaged [Gorga] on the post to please remove it, but he never responded. I DMed him as well and he never responded either.</p>Caley Svensson<p>Page Six said it confirmed through online property records that Caley and husband Erik Svensson were the owners of the home, which appears to be the same as Joe’s “after” photo.</p><p>Gorga blaming the incident on a social media manager, claiming they “made a mistake”. However, he said he had some involvement in the project as he acted as a “private lender”.</p><p>Erik Svensson told Page Six he accepted Gorga’s explanation their house was mistakenly posted as a “flip”.</p><p>Reality Titbit has reached out to Joe Gorga for comment.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY ON BRAVO TUESDAYS AT 8/7C</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfl7%2Biws5oqaGnnp%2FAbrbOnmSgp6Kcrm6twpysrJ2UYryneceorKydXZu5qrzPoqWgZZWnv7C%2B0mamp2WZo8C1rcarmKY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-imogen-mckay-alex-beresford-26687143.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Imogen McKay as Alex Beresford announces wedding</span></a>
