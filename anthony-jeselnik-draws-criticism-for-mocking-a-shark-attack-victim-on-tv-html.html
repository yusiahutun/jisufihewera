New Zealand’s <a href=#>One News</a>&nbsp;reports that the victim’s family (unsurprisingly) was “disgusted” by the segment, which concludes with Jeselnik putting the victim’s photo onscreen and calling him a “son of a bitch.” Being deliberately shocking and offensive and saying things he doesn’t mean to provoke an audience has been Jeselnik’s thing for years, and this bit doesn’t go that much further than previous things he’s said onstage but it lacks the wit of Jeselnik’s finely-crafted jokes and has been drawing a negative response in the media and on YouTube, where the video has gotten an overwhelming amount of thumbs-downs. Do you think Anthony Jeselnik crossed the line?
