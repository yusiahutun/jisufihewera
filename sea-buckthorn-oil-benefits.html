It’s been a go-to treatment in certain areas of the world for centuries — and for good reason.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is sea buckthorn oil?</h2><p>Sea buckthorn oil, which is also sometimes called sea buckthorn seed oil, comes from the sea buckthorn plant that grows in higher-altitude regions of the Himalayas in Asia. It’s been part of Chinese and Ayurvedic medicinal practices for thousands of years, and it’s even called the “holy fruit” in some cultures.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>It’s worked hard to earn that title! Sea buckthorn oil is chock full of a number of incredible vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, including magnesium, calcium, iron, folate, vitamin C, and several B vitamins. It also has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quercetin</a>, a compound proven to lower blood pressure and prevent heart disease. One study also showed that people who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">regularly take this supplement</a> may reduce signs of blood clots in just four weeks.</p><p>Additionally, animal studies have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shown promising results</a> with sea buckthorn oil decreasing blood sugar levels and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">managing sugar level spikes</a> after meals. Plus, for women who are perimenopausal, postmenopausal, or actually going through menopause, it can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">help with vaginal dryness</a>, especially as estrogen levels become more erratic over time.</p><p>Other research also suggests there may be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even more benefits</a>, including boosting the immune system, aiding in liver health, and <a href=#>healing skin damage</a> (if applied topically).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the side effects?</h2><p>There are currently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">very few reported side effects</a>, but they include swelling, headaches, and dizziness. People who are on blood thinning medication should also avoid sea buckthorn oil since it has its own blood-thinning properties. For those who apply it directly to their skin, it could be itchy or irritating.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How should you take it?</h2><p>You can take sea buckthorn oil in a number of ways if you want to try it out. You can infuse the oil (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy on Amazon, $10.95</a>) into smoothies, soups, or other foods, or take capsules (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy on Amazon, $27.89</a>). There are also special topical serums for those who want to put it directly on their skin (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy on Amazon, $15.95</a>). Just make sure to first try it on a small patch of skin, like on your wrist, before covering a larger area. No matter what you choose, make sure you get your doctor’s go-ahead before you get started.</p><p>On top of the supplements, sea buckthorn fruit has also been used in cooking for many years, so that’s another way to get some of its helpful nutritional benefits. If you’re able to get your hands on some online (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy on Amazon, $8.99</a>), mixing it into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this jam</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this meringue pie</a> could do the trick. Sounds like a fun cooking project!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJon56ZnKm1cL%2FEmmSbrZOgwam70adkqKGcYq%2BmusSfoK2r</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./416097-list-aurora-teagarden-movies-order-release-html.html><span>←</span><span>List of all Aurora Teagarden movies in order of release</span></a>
