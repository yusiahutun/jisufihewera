"David McCallum was a mentor, a great scene partner, a wonderful father and husband, and he was my dear friend," Brian wrote on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXNvs4jeCm9 data-wc=75>"I met David on my first day of work at NCIS. I was booked to work one day on the show, but David and I hit it off. Our scene turned out well and they invited me back for more scenes with this screen legend. Several more. Over the course of the next 20 years, David and I (along with our alter-ego's Ducky and Jimmy) developed a deep friendship and love of our shared work."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/541fdf181b35-brian-dietzen-and-david-mccallum-pose-on-set-ncis.jpg><p id=ePoGi4B5rO8 data-wc=69>Noting that David acted as a career mentor, Brian added: "He had a quick and wry sense of humor and was generous with advice when I asked for it. He was also quick to share praise for work well done. I loved getting a phone call from him after a show aired to hear him talk about the scenes (even as he appeared less and less in our show)."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Brian Dietzen's life and career: From NCIS stardom to health struggles and family life in LA" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1b437b72bdf1-brian-dietzen-as-jimmy-palmer.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Brian Dietzen's life and career: From NCIS stardom to health struggles and family life in LA" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Brian Dietzen's life and career: From NCIS stardom to health struggles and family life in LA</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="David McCallum's lookalike famous son revealed – and he's following in his dad's footsteps" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ad1b0bf92c95-gettyimages-1243561355.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="David McCallum's lookalike famous son revealed – and he's following in his dad's footsteps" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>David McCallum's lookalike famous son revealed – and he's following in his dad's footsteps</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Inside Rocky Carroll's friendship with 'biggest supporter' Mark Harmon" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fa4507ca34ae-rocky-carroll-and-mark-harmon-in-ncis.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Inside Rocky Carroll's friendship with 'biggest supporter' Mark Harmon" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Inside Rocky Carroll's friendship with 'biggest supporter' Mark Harmon</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Everything late NCIS star David McCallum said about his wife Katherine Carpenter" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3fdcde6c30c4-david-mccallum-wife.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Everything late NCIS star David McCallum said about his wife Katherine Carpenter" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Everything late NCIS star David McCallum said about his wife Katherine Carpenter</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ejZb2TM6hMv data-wc=52>Brian continued: "The friendship and respect people saw between Ducky and Jimmy over the years mirrored the relationship we'd developed off camera. Whether it was going on field trips for character research, attending charity events or catching some golf together, he was always up for an adventure. The guy could do anything."</p><p id=e0Qd6FuSeHe data-wc=25>From pictures alone, it's clear that Brian and David loved being in each other's company, with the late star often posting behind-the-scenes photos on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6cc13f5996b7-brian-david-ncis.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Their final conversation</h2><p id=e5BW-HfE-pp data-wc=51>Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>TV Line</a>, Brian shared that he had been fortunate to have chatted to David six days before his passing.

That was his 90th birthday, a few days before he passed away. We got to speak, we got to chat. He was coherent and all that…I'm really, really glad that I got to speak to him one last time. It was really wonderful."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Brian's final tribute to his dear friend</h2><p id=eMJ_EVOTceF data-wc=69>Asked to write a tribute episode, Brian was honored to take up the mantle: "When David passed away, Scott Williams, my co-writer, volunteered to do this episode and he said to me, 'I thought it was only right that you co-write with me,'" he told the publication. "And then everybody in the room said, 'Yeah, that's perfect. That's what should happen.' And I said, 'Absolutely, I'd be honored to.'"</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>NCIS' special tribute episode to David McCallum – trailer</figure><p id=ejcmIa6-aDn data-wc=23>Chatting to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Variety</a>, Brian noted that while it was a strange way to process his grief, writing the episode was a "cathartic" experience.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKBn6ERfp-Xv data-wc=75>"One of the biggest things that I wanted to talk about and explore had to do with the loss of any friend or a loved one, but that really works really hand-in-glove with the character of Ducky: He told so many stories, over the course of the last 20 years at NCIS, and that I think is what a lot of people remember that character for. I certainly will; me playing Jimmy Palmer," he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8341056e1af4-ncis-stars-david-mccallum-and-brian-dietzen.jpg><p id=eEo_9k9tuwGz data-wc=64>"The name of this episode is 'The Stories We Leave Behind.' So that's what I wanted to do to honor him, to recognize that those stories are earned and meaningful. You add 'em up altogether and you have a very full life, and that very full life is all we really leave behind to affect people; once we're gone, those stories become our legacy."&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
