I looked at the building and said, ‘That’s a diving board, my friend.’”</p><p>Flea went first and landed safely, however, unfortunately, the same could not be said for Kiedis.</p><p>“I jumped, and as I was in the air, I realized that I had put too much into the leap and I was going to overshoot the pool, but there was nothing I could do about it,” he recalled.</p><p>“The concrete was coming up at me, and I landed smack on my heels and missed the pool by about ten inches.”</p><p>Although a huge accident, the star kept his consciousness, although the pain was described as “nothing else he’s ever felt.”</p><p>“‘You broke your back, and it doesn’t look so good’,” the doctor said. His vertebrae were ‘flattened like pancakes’ although was told “a month in traction would help stretch them back.”</p><p>A huge injury, that can damage mobility for life, Kiedis was fit and <a href=#>healthy</a> again in a matter of weeks, although some may not have even survived that nasty fall.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-rockstar-says-he-doesn-t-consider-himself-a-musician>The rockstar says he ‘doesn’t consider himself a musician’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1698106471-1024x683.jpg><p>Although part of one of the most iconic rock bands in history, the star revealed on his bandmate Flea’s podcast, This Little Light, that he doesn’t actually consider himself a ‘musician.’</p><p>Flea admitted that the conversation left the <a href=#>celebrity</a> friends “in tears,” and speaking to the Los Angeles Times about one of his favorite episodes, the 61-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>:</p><p>“A really good one was with Anthony. We were both kind of in tears because I’d never talked to him about stuff like that.</p><p>Anthony doesn’t really consider himself a musician or that he’s had any music education whatsoever. He used to say we should change the band’s name to Idiot and the Three Geniuses.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2h%2BcL7EnWShp6RisKm1y6WgZqiVpb2mvtJmnaunnqm6orqMp5yaqpyueq270q1koaGjYrmqssRmmZ6bkarApnnOn2SaZZaaxG61zZyfnqtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rachel-mcadams-sexy-turtleneck-ahead-broadway-debut-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rachel McAdams turns heads in a sexy open-back turtleneck in NYC ahead of Broadway debutin Amy Her</span></a>
