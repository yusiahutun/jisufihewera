Season 13 of <a href=#>Married at First Sight</a> may be over but the drama is far from it. During the Wednesday, November 17, reunion special, <a href=#>some of the couples</a> — who are now exes — shared surprising life updates.</p><p>One pair who agreed to split at the reunion was <strong>Ryan</strong> and <strong>Brett</strong> — but it wasn’t exactly as cordial as some thought. Ryan’s sister, <strong>Alexa</strong>, opened up about her relationship with Brett during the reunion special, and claimed that she later found out Brett was “seeing someone” and lying to her about it.</p><p>“I’m not seeing anybody. I did meet somebody, but I didn’t pursue anything with them until everything was said and done, and that’s also a situation that’s done,” Brett explained, noting that she exchanged numbers with someone she met before Decision Day and stayed and touch “here and there” but it was not a distraction from her marriage.</p><p>Ryan replied that he’s “seen conversations” and claims there was “more than just exchanging numbers” beginning on the night they met. Still, they remain friends.</p><p>That’s not the case for all, however.</p><p>One of the <a href=#>fan favorite couples of the season</a> were <strong>Myrla</strong> and <strong>Gil</strong>, who had quite an up and down journey but still chose to stay married on the finale and then moved in together.</p><p>“Unfortunately, since Decision Day, we have not been together,” he revealed at the reunion. “14 days after Decision Day, Myrla decided she <a href=#>didn’t want to be with me</a> anymore.”</p><p>As for what went wrong, “it was a variety of things,” she explained. “I think for me, it was just acknowledging that we<a href=#> are just so different</a>. The things that I had said were just non-negotiables for me were really important to me. For me, financial stability is really important.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>With that, he replied, “I make $100 more every two weeks than she makes.”</p><p>However, it was not really about the money after all.
