&#34;I think our years of cutting full length albums are on hold right now,&#34; Jay DeMarcus says. &#34;Back to Life&#34; — a rangey power ballad — is one of five or six new song they've cut, but the bigger picture is&nbsp;an album of re-imagined cover songs they're hard at work&nbsp;on after 10 years worth of conversations."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

"Maybe not him specifically, but somebody that we admire like that.&nbsp;It'd be cool to&nbsp;have Brian McKnight come in and sing 'One Last Cry' with Gary. We've definitely talked about all those possibilities."</p><p class=p1>One of the new songs may also include a female duet partner for vocalist Gary LeVox. <a href=#>Lauren Alaina</a> cut&nbsp;"Are You Happy Now" with them on the trio's most recent studio album Back to Us.&nbsp;They say they hope to recreate that magic, but right now it sounds like LeVox's daughter, Brittany, is not an option, even though the 17-year-old is serious about pursuing music as a career. She wants to do it herself.</p><p class=p1>"It's all she does all day long," LeVox says. "She loves country, she loves gospel, she loves the pop stuff. So we'll see what road she decides to take, but all of it's embedded in her."</p><p class=p1>"She's a lot like her daddy," Joe Don Rooney adds.</p><p class=p1>Taste of Country Nights is a syndicated night show which airs on nearly 100 radio stations nationwide.
