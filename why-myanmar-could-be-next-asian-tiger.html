After meetings with government representatives, senior executives and think-tank leaders in Myanmar, I spent some time exploring the beautiful nation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Yangon, Myanmar's window to the world, you quickly get an idea of the debilitated infrastructure, the poverty and the searing heat - and the ingenuity of ordinary people and their dream of a better future.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Economically, Myanmar has lost half a century of progress and prosperity</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since taking office, President Thein Sein has significantly improved Myanmar's ties with Washington and European countries, which has unleashed a rapid inflow of Western capital. In the Traders Hotel favoured by foreign executives, for example, the cheapest overnight stay costs more than US$300 - even as ordinary people struggle to live on US$1-US$2 per day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The government has embarked on a series of bold reforms to direct the country toward democratisation, a mixed economy and reconciliation. With most international sanctions suspended and despite bitter ethnic tensions that continue to escalate, the reform momentum remains strong. However, the transition will take time and is not devoid of risks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Economically, Myanmar has lost half a century of progress and prosperity. In the 1960s, it was a major rice exporter, with average prosperity 10 per cent higher than in China, as measured by GDP per capita. By the onset of the global crisis of 2008, average prosperity was 55 per cent lower than in China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the past four years, Myanmar's real gross domestic product has been growing at an estimated 5-6 per cent. In the next five years, it could sustain a growth rate of 6-8 per cent. But the starting-point is very low. Myanmar's per capita GDP is barely US$1,400, and nearly a quarter of the 48 million people live below the poverty line.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With underdeveloped institutional capabilities, poor revenue performance has led to persistent fiscal deficits, which have been financed by the central bank. As a result, volatile inflation averaged 23 per cent between 2001 and 2010, which hit the poor hard.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Myanmar has a young labour force, abundant natural resources, including natural gas, copper, timber and gemstones. Nonetheless, given the high reliance on natural resources and low productivity in agriculture, the economy remains vulnerable to shocks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the recent influx of Western money and speculators, China remains Myanmar's largest foreign investor. Naypyidaw, the country's political capital, is engaged in a delicate balancing act between the old Chinese investment and the new Western capital.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Worse, Myanmar is opening in an era of low interest rates and massive liquidity injections in the West, while Japan, its biggest creditor, has initiated a massive gamble of monetary expansion, and growth is slowing in emerging Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like China in the early 1980s, Myanmar cannot quickly establish institutional capabilities that would have the confidence of foreign investors. As a result, it is moving towards "special economic zones". If such zones can be established near major urban centres, such as Yangon and Mandalay, they could accelerate economic growth and attract more foreign multinationals and investors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If the current and achievable growth goal of 7.7 per cent could be sustained in the coming years, Myanmar would emerge as the next Asian tiger - but not without inclusive growth.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Reformed Myanmar could be next Asian tiger to roar</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWeZo8Cqs8etZKiomaO2sLqOmqmtoZOhsnB9kWxtcmpiZMSpxYymsJqmnZa%2Fbq%2FOrqOdZZKaeq%2Bx161kmquZlrtuwMignKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-paparemborde.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Paparemborde</span></a>
