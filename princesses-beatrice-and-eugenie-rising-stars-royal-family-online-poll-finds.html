Instead, opting for a snack rich in nuts and seeds provides a sustained energy release because of their healthy fats and fibre, which helps stabilise blood sugar levels. Alternatively, a lean meat option offers protein, which helps avoid the energy crash.</p><p id=eAD-v8XmN_ data-wc=36><strong>Dinner</strong>: "Consider a light yet satisfying meal featuring lean proteins like fish, paired with colourful vegetables.
