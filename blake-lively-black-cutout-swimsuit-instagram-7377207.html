And in the first photo, she posed on a balcony overlooking the ocean while dressed in a brown, white, and beige geometric-patterned bikini top with light-wash denim overalls and layers of gold chain necklaces, featuring seashell-shaped pendants. Blake went makeup-free and wore her long blonde hair in natural wind-blown waves. A mirror selfie, meanwhile, showed her in the same patterned bikini top, but this time with a different coverup consisting of a maxi skirt in a contrasting print from Free People.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lively's second swimwear look in the slideshow included a classic black one-piece with a major midriff-baring cutout in the middle. The opening was so big, her suit almost looked like a full-on bikini with a pair of separate high-waisted bottoms and a top.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Blake Lively Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other photos showed Reynolds solo on the beach and a sweet snap of the couple with their moms — all dressed in white.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in February, it was announced that Lively and Reynolds's three daughters — James, Inez, and Betty — officially had a new sibling and that they were taking their 'big sister' roles in stride. "Blake and Ryan are amazing together. Ryan is a great dad. He is very sweet to Blake," a source previously shared with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>People</a> following the birth of their fourth child. "They are very excited about the new baby. The older siblings have adjusted great."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57waWYpJ1doba3scuyZJukkZi4bq%2FUraaurF2oxKq50q6grWWZo8C1rcarmKZlZ2iEeH6PcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-high-waisted-swimsuits.html><span>←</span><span>25 Best High Waisted Swimsuits 2024</span></a>
