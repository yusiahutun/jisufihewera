This dish is filled with creamy, rich and savory flavors just like the classic cheese-topped soup — it’s a comforting combo that’s a guaranteed hit. Even better, cleanup is easy as you can even cook all of the ingredients in the same pot. Ready to give it a try? Here’s how to make French onion pasta that delivers on big flavor without a lot of work.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is French onion pasta?</h2><p>This dish consists of pasta that’s coated in a sauce made with caramelized onions, butter, cheese, broth and seasonings. The combination of ingredients produces a cheesy and pungent dish that’s <a href=# rel=noopener>gone viral</a> on TikTok with several variations for making it at home.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Traditional vs. one-pot French onion pasta</h2><p>The way you prepare this dish comes down to how much time you have. Cooking the pasta and sauce base together is the quicker option as it doesn’t involve waiting for the water to boil or draining the noodles. Once the sauce is thickened and the pasta is tender, you can serve it right out of the pot. While this method produces delicious results faster, boiling the pasta separately is ideal if you like adding the starchy cooking liquid to the sauce. This way the sauce can reach your desired consistency — no extra butter or cream needed. As long as you’re building layers of flavor within the dish, either method works to create tasty pasta in an hour or less!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3 tips for making delicious French onion pasta</h2><p>Although French onion pasta uses pantry staples, these tips ensure you’ll maximize the most flavor from the core ingredients!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Cook the onions so they’re soft and jammy.</h3><p>Since the onions are the backbone of the dish, it’s best to caramelize them until they’re sweet and tender. This usually takes around 40 minutes in a pan over a gentle heat. But, our story on <a href=#>quick caramelized onions</a> reveals how to do it in half the time. (Spoiler: It starts with cranking up the heat to medium-high!)</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Choose the right pasta shape.</h3><p>Since this sauce is rich and velvety, a short pasta shape with ridges or holes will yield a more flavorful bite than long, thin varieties. “Choose a pasta shape that holds sauce well, like penne, cavatappi or radiatore,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Lindsey Chastain</a>, founder and CEO of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Waddle and Cluck</a>, says. Other pasta shapes including <a href=#>cavatelli</a>, rigatoni and orecchiette work fine too.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Pour in a good-quality broth.</h3><p>Stirring in a good-quality beef, chicken or vegetable does the trick for amping up the sauce’s savory flavors. Try a store-bought variety like Pacific Foods’ Organic Free Range Chicken Broth (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Walmart, $3.18</a>) as it will instantly infuse the sauce with the aromatic essence of chicken, herbs and vegetables.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make French onion pasta</h2><p>If you’re ready to add French onion pasta to your weeknight menu, pick the recipe below that suits your needs. Then, serve the dish alongside cooked meat or vegetables to make it a complete meal.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Caramelized Onion Pasta</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Caramelized-Onion-Pasta-With-Mushrooms.jpg><p>Chastain’s recipe cooks the noodles and sauce separately, and you can enhance the dish by sautéeing the onions with sliced mushrooms for an earthy kick.</p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>3 large onions, sliced&nbsp;</li><li>3 Tbs. butter&nbsp;</li><li>3 Tbs. olive oil&nbsp;</li><li>1 lb. penne pasta&nbsp;or another short pasta shape</li><li>1 cup beef, chicken or vegetable broth&nbsp;</li><li>½ cup heavy cream&nbsp;</li><li>1 tsp. fresh thyme&nbsp;</li><li>1 cup shredded cheese like Gruyère, provolone or swiss</li><li>Salt and pepper</li></ul><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Yield: </strong>4 to 6 servings</li></ul><li>In large skillet over medium-high heat, cook sliced onions with butter and olive oil about 15 to 20 minutes.
