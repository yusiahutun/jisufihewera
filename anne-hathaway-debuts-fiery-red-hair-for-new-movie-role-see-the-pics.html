Even if it requires dying her hair fire-engine-red — which she just did, in case you missed it. Anne was spotted filming in NYC this week for her role in&nbsp;Modern Love&nbsp;looking nearly unrecognizable while sporting her new crimson locks.</p><p>The Ocean’s 8 actress is just one of a few actors who landed among the star-studded cast chosen for Amazon’s upcoming series. Anne will be co-starring alongside <a href=#>Tina Fey</a>, John Slattery, Dev Patel, Catherine Keener, Cristin Miloti, and more.&nbsp;Modern Love is a series of eight standalone episodes that will explore love in its many forms — including sexual, romantic, familial, platonic, and self-love, according to <a href=#>Deadline</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/anne-hathaway-fiery-red-hair.jpg><p>In preparation for filming, the 35-year-old switched out her iconic brunette head of hair for some luscious red locks. And this isn’t the first time that Anne has changed up her typical look for a movie role.</p><p>In 2012, Anne admitted to <a href=#>Vogue</a> that she dropped 10 pounds through a strict cleanse before shooting Les Miserables. The Oscar-winning actress also revealed that she lost another 15 pounds by following an extreme, two-week diet that left her nearly starving.</p><p>“I had to be obsessive about it. The idea was to look near death,” Anne said of her meals that consisted of two thin squares of dried oatmeal paste a day. “Looking back on the whole experience, and I don’t judge it in any way, it was definitely a little nuts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/anne-hathaway-dancing-red-hair.jpg><p>In addition to preparing to play&nbsp;dying prostitute Fantine by losing weight, Anne also had to shave all her hair off for&nbsp;Les Miserables&nbsp;as she didn’t want to rely on props or special effects. <a href=#>The Devil Wears Prada</a> star admitted that the role left her feeling empty, but we imagine it was all worth it. “I was in such a state of deprivation — physical and emotional. When I got home, I couldn’t react to the chaos of the world without being overwhelmed. It took me weeks till I felt like myself again.”</p><p>Thankfully, so far this role in Modern Love only requires her to dye her hair — and, we must say, the red hue truly looks amazing on her!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46apaedXZ2utbTAsJiyZZSar7bA0madop2irnqzscNmn5qhomKzsL6Mp5ywZZ2kw6qxjKumpZ1dqLKmedOhnGaomZjAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cara-santana-jesse-metcalfe-engagement-ring-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>A little extra sparkle!
