The group established the First Day Project in 2006 to coordinate and enhance school supply collections taking place in different Quad City communities and engage local businesses and volunteer groups to help meet the needs of kindergarten through 12th-grade students who may not otherwise have the means to buy school supplies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKicZaeesaZ5kKyrZpyRrnqxvs6jnJysXaiyprfSZqqcoJ%2BkuW6%2F1KmnpbFdmbyvrdOipqerXZu8s3nAq5yaZaOpwqWxza2qaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coats-sale-nordstrom-half-yearly-event.html><span>←</span><span>Nordstrom's Half-Yearly Sale Has So Many Coats &amp;amp; Jackets Discounted</span></a>
