Since then, she’s catapulted to supermodel status, partnering with luxury brands from Calvin Klein to Dior. But how much, exactly, does she make from her stints behind the camera and on the runway?</p><p>Read on below to find out just *how much* <a href=# id=auto-tag_kendall-jenner data-tag=kendall-jenner>Kendall Jenner</a>‘s net worth is in 2022, and catch up on episodes of&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians&nbsp;and Hulu’s&nbsp;The Kardashians&nbsp;below.</p><h2><strong>How much did Kendall Jenner make from&nbsp;</strong><strong>Keeping Up With the Kardashians?</strong></h2><p>Since 2017, it’s been generally understood that each KarJenner sister received the same salary from&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians&nbsp;per season. Momager Kris Jenner essentially confirmed as much in an interview on&nbsp;The Ellen DeGeneres&nbsp;Show. “Everybody gets paid pretty much equally, because we all film a lot and we all work hard, and we’ve created this show and this brand for the last decade. Everybody’s happy,” she said.</p><p>At the time, the KarJenner sisters were estimated to be earning $4.5 million per season. While sisters like Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé may earn a little more thanks to their production credits on the series, the Jenner sisters likely saw a salary in line with that baseline estimate.</p><h2><strong>How much is Kendall Jenner’s&nbsp;</strong><strong>The Kardashians&nbsp;</strong><strong>salary?</strong></h2><p>Following the series finale of&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the KarJenner family made their return to reality TV with their Hulu show,&nbsp;The Kardashians.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Variety</a>, the series, which premiered in April 2022, comes with a nine-figure salary deal that will be split evenly among the family.</p><p>Kendall’s sister Khloé confirmed to the publication that each member of the family will receive the same salary. “We are all equals,” she said, noting that the monetary aspect for their contract negotiations was an important part of their decision to return to reality TV. “It definitely played a factor because we give so much of our personal lives up for entertainment,” Khloé explained. “We always have our private family conversations, and we’re pretty brutal, me and my sisters, with what we will settle for or not settle for.”</p><p>“But not all money is good money,” Khloé said, adding that the Kardashian family also wanted their next opportunity to align with their goals. “It has to be a good fit, and Hulu was just the perfect fit for us. It can’t just be for monetary gain. That doesn’t seem to work for us.”</p><p>She added, “It sounds so old fashioned, but we are people who applaud ourselves in so many other facets of our life that we are ahead of the time. We wanted to be with someone that’s tech forward, so we’re with the times. For us to be still on cable was just not so on brand for us. My mom deals with all the negotiating, and we let her do that because it is uncomfortable. She fights like a pit bull. She loves to do it and we let her do it.”</p><p>Walt Disney Television’s chairman of entertainment, Dana Walden, also confirmed that the Kardashian family’s deal for their Hulu show did not come cheap. “We stepped up to a great deal that they very much deserve,” Walden told Variety, suggesting, however, that the family was well worth the investment. “Who would you want more for your unscripted slate than the Kardashians? They perfectly symbolize our strategy, which is taking big shots, but the right shots, and betting on incredible talent and best-in-class opportunities in each genre.”</p><h2><strong>What is Kendall Jenner’s net worth?</strong></h2><p>So, what’s Kendall Jenner’s net worth today? According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Kendall Jenner’s net worth as of 2022 is estimated to be $45 million.</p><p>In addition to her salaries from&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Kardashians,&nbsp;Kendall’s net worth got to the place it is today due to her modeling career. While Kendall’s been in the modeling industry for years, it’s safe to say that her career really began to reach new heights when she signed with The Society Management in 2013. With this new contract, she started shifting her focus to high fashion. Which is to say, Kendall suddenly had far more lucrative deals with high-profile brands—from Marc Jabobs, Givenchy, and Dior, to Balmain, Dolce & Gabbana, and of course, her<a href=#>&nbsp;memorable deal</a>&nbsp;with<a href=#>&nbsp;Calvin Klein Jeans</a>.</p><p>Like her sisters, Kendall also makes a decent living on Instagram. With over 127 million followers, the young model can earn anywhere from thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars on sponsored posts. Even the ones that, uh, <a href=#>turn sour</a>.</p><p>The Kardashians&nbsp;is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu</a>. Here’s how to <a href=# rel=noopener>watch it for free</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kris-Jenner-and-All-Things-Kardashian.jpg><p>For more about the Kardashians, check out Kris Jenner’s 2011 memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Kris Jenner…And All Things Kardashians</a>, in which the momager tells her never-before-told story about how she led her six children—Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, Rob, Kendall and Kylie—to international stardom and built their multi-million dollar empire. You may think you know the Kardashians, but as Kris explains in her book, what’s in the media and in Keeping Up With the Kardashians is only the tip of the iceberg. In Kris Jenner…And All Things Kardashians, Kris reveals how she balanced six children (not to mention four stepchildren and numerous grandchildren) while building a business for her family. The book also dives into Kris’ relationship with Nicole Brown Simpson before and after her husband, O.J. Simpson, was accused of her murder. Kris Jenner…And All Things Kardashians is a must-read for any Kardashian fan.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
