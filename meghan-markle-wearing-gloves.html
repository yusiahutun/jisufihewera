The last three engagements that the wife of Prince Harry has been on, she has been spotted holding her gloves, but not actually wearing them. During a trip to Bristol's Old Vic last week, the royal was spotted holding her khaki green clutch bag and matching gloves, despite the freezing, snowy conditions. And on a visit to Smart Works in January, the former Suits star once again carried her camel-toned gloves instead of wearing them. Even as far back as Christmas Day, the Duchess decided not to wear her black leather gloves in Sandringham at Church, holding them in the same hand as her<strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Victoria Beckham handbag</a></strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef7470cc41d0-meghan-markle-bristol-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ek5MJw0K_7g data-wc=5><strong>Meghan often carries her gloves</strong></p><p id=edw2QHd5aJY7 data-wc=66>It could be that Meghan, 37, is simply taking style tips from the Queen who always has her gloves to hand. &nbsp;HELLO! spoke to Cornelia James, glove maker to the royal family, who said: "You never see her without her hat, her handbag or her gloves. Nobody apart from the queen wears gloves all the time. They are part of her integral style and she's iconic."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/56c0cfd2cffb-meghan-markle-kate-middleton-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=egaMPbnRic8R data-wc=14><strong>At Christmas, Duchess Kate wore a pair of gloves whilst Meghan kept hers off...</strong></p><p id=e0g7n3GPaD2f data-wc=17>Also, she wears gloves because she's shaking a lot of hands.
