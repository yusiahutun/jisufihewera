Bentley and his longtime stylist, Annie Psaltiras, helped to create the line&nbsp;which aligns with Bentley's personal dress style.</p><p>"This has been such a fun thing to create and develop,"&nbsp;he says. "I love clothes that are perfectly worn-in like you’ve had them a lifetime, but can also take the wear and tear that comes from an active lifestyle. I’ve learned over the last few months that there’s a real art to getting that just right. The Flag & Anthem guys have been doing it at the highest level and have helped me put together a collection that I think is totally authentic to me and one that hopefully people all over the country will dig too."</p><p>Desert Son is available at Buckle, Von Maur and Dillard’s and <a href=#>online</a>.</p><p><strong>See All Country Tours Slated for 2018!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnaGVp7i0ecGepa2kla56pLjOrZ%2Bippdiuaq6xGabnquVp8Fuv86nZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christmas-quotes.html><span>←</span><span>97 Short Christmas Quotes to Inspire Holiday Joy 2023</span></a>
