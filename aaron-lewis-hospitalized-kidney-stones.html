Lewis has concerts scheduled in Florida, Arkansas and Louisiana this weekend, followed by an album release on Jan. 28. Frayed at Both Ends is his new country-rock album, featuring "<a href=#>Am I the Only One</a>" and a new song called "Everybody Talks to God." <a href=#>Vince Gill </a>and Dan Tyminski also appear on a song called "They Call Me Doc."</p><p>Frayed at Both Ends is Lewis' third album under the Big Machine Label Group umbrella.&nbsp;He has not yet scored a radio airplay hit, but several songs have done very well on sales charts.
