High-frequency traders (HFTs) are powered by algorithm-driven computer models that instantly analyse trading patterns and can rapidly execute massive orders.
A big fear for traditional traders is that they are “gamed” by HFTs, including by methods such as bombarding an exchange or ”dark pool” with thousands of quotes in a matter of milliseconds and then cancelling orders after real investors are drawn out."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

They are popular among large investors who can trade without revealing their identity or displaying prices to the general public.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To counter that fear, brokers are investing in technology and stepping up the use of algorithms that jumble and randomize orders or seek out alternative venues so that traditional investors can know their trading strategies are protected.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The systems have to mimic what humans would do, but do it a lot faster,” said Butler.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It has also meant more surveillance of orders filled and then quickly cancelled, and regular scrutiny of who is trading in their dark pools to ensure clients do not feel they are trading at a disadvantage to the HFTs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s my job as someone who brings clients to the market to deal with the benefits and risks that HFT brings,” said Glenn Lesko, CEO of Instinet Asia-Pacific.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’d say avoiding them is impossible and not even necessary. Having intelligent algorithmic capabilities is the answer.”<br>The growing acceptance of HFTs reflects that in a world of shrinking leverage, fragmented markets and falling volumes, they provide much needed liquidity on trading platforms and valuable revenue for exchanges.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It would be easy to label HFT strategies in general as either good or bad, but I believe in differentiating between HFT strategies which add useful liquidity and those that do not,” said Jacqueline Loh, head of trading at Schroeders Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“HFT strategies such as index arbitrage and gamma hedging provide good liquidity for long-only funds, while the more predatory HFT strategies mask the true levels of liquidity in the market,” said Loh.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">It’s my job as someone who brings clients to the market to deal with the benefits and risks that HFT brings.
