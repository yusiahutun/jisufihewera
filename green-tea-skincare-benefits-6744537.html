"It also contains tannins and caffeine which shrinks blood vessels and reduce puffiness."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Jeanine Downie</a>, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Image Dermatology, says green tea can also help repair DNA damage and prevent tumor formation.

With that said, formulas containing green tea typically don't cause any side effects unless there is a known allergy. When in doubt, do a patch test when trying any new skincare product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Downie says those over 35 may particularly benefit from including green tea in their skincare routine. "Green tea should be included in the anti-aging skin care regimen of anybody over the age of 35 that has a decent amount of sun exposure," she shares. "That is all races, ethnicities, and sexes. As white men over the age of 50 get <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>skin cancer</a> more than anybody else, they should really be looking into green tea benefits by their 40s if not earlier."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-should-you-add-green-tea-to-your-skincare-routine></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How should you add green tea to your skincare routine?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are a number of skincare products on the market that are formulated with green tea, but Dr. Capote recommends using ones that also contains other antioxidants as they'll work synergistically. "Serums and moisturizers packed with antioxidants are the best products to look out for," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, the combination of green tea and caffeine in a serum can be beneficial for reducing redness and puffiness. And if your skin is compromised, Dr. Capote suggests also adding a gentle face wash into the mix. "For those with compromised skin, consider adding on additional&nbsp;green&nbsp;tea&nbsp;in the form of a gentle wash," she says. "It is so safe that anyone can benefit from its healing and anti-aging properties."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-will-drinking-green-tea-provide-the-same-skincare-benefits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Will drinking green tea provide the same skincare benefits?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While drinking green tea offers a number of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>proven health benefits</a> — such as boosting brain function, balancing blood sugar, and lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease — both dermatologists say applying it topically is the best way to reap its skincare benefits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Yes, you can get some of the same benefits by drinking green tea. However, putting it on the skin in a serum can decrease fine lines and wrinkles and protect the skin against carcinogenic effects as well as being anti-inflammatory more thoroughly than just drinking it," Dr. Downie says. "If you are interested in improving the quality of your skin, I would put it on topically and drink green tea."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Capote elaborates: "There have been no studies comparing the&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;from applying in&nbsp;skincare&nbsp;vs drinking, however it does seem there is more data that drinking&nbsp;green&nbsp;tea&nbsp;provides more health&nbsp;benefits. EGCG [the antioxidant found in green tea] is hydrophilic and is limited in skin penetration so perhaps oral ingestion may provide additional&nbsp;benefits."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From non-toxic makeup and skincare to sustainability practices,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Clean Slate</a>&nbsp;is an exploration of all things in the green beauty space.
