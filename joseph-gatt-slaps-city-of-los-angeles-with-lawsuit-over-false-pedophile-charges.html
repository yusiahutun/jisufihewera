He is suing for the alleged violation of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, following what his lawyers call a "botched" investigation.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>In the court documents</strong></a> which were filed in the Federal Court of California on Thursday, Gatt claims the defendants "intentionally" ruined his acting career and personal reputation "from a thoroughly botched criminal investigation, entirely lacking any probable cause."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b799eb4f-2bc7-4837-be69-43751386918c data-container-ref=toofab:article:7c2cf106-c4ed-4a86-8945-1d5de7df7ebc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6c/5by4/2023/09/22/6cb0a9b626814624ac6c3d87ab93c620_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">John Grisham, George R.R.

The fan then contacted Gatt on a few other occasions, with the suit claiming Gatt replied "in a manner that was wholly appropriate and consistent with typical celebrity-fan exchanges."</p><p>He claimed she then began to share "wholly manufactured fake conversations between herself and Gatt via the social media platform Snapchat that were sexual in nature and pure fantasy," which were found by her older sister and reported to authorities.</p><p>The suit says as a celebrity, Gatt's earning capacity is tied in part to social media engagement. It also says the actor never met the teen fan in person -- and alleges the fan wasn't even interviewed until a year after his arrest.</p><p>"Based solely on the allegations of a single, admittedly obsessed 16-year-old fan whom they had never bothered to interview to that point, along with facially untrustworthy photographs of alleged Snapchat conversations with that fan that they made no effort to verify against the actual electronic or online data relating to these alleged conversations, Defendants recklessly and publicly branded Gatt to the public as a serial pedophile," reads the suit. "Even more egregiously, they did so even though they had already spent hours searching through Gatt’s personal phone and computer and had found no evidence whatsoever of any improper communications with Jane Doe or any other minor."</p><a id=gallery-link-d9f92cdb-477c-45f5-a5f5-a4dc9684f4cd class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:d9f92cdb-477c-45f5-a5f5-a4dc9684f4cd data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:7c2cf106-c4ed-4a86-8945-1d5de7df7ebc data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/dc/4by3/2024/04/03/dcba815ca0a1443ab5200fd772ff016e_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maW1fn7y0sc%2BhZKCZpKl6tLjAqapmm5mpxm67xWajqKtdlruoscueqmavmam1brjAsKquoaRivLex0WadmqSjmnqxscOop6GhnJp6pLTAq56eq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blake-shelton-i-dont-care-song-that-was-never-a-single.html><span>←</span><span>Blake Shelton Shares Song He Still Regrets Wasn't a Single</span></a>
