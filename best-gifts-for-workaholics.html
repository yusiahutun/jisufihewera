If you’re one of my friends, that person is probably me (oops!). Anyway, I’m not the only millennial committed to working hard, even if that means sacrificing wine night or the workout that my anxiety-ridden body desperately needs. With all of this being said, I’m basically the perfect person to suggest the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">best gifts for workaholic</a> friends. You could book them a weekend getaway or a <a href=# rel=noopener>massage at a luxe spa</a>, but you that these types are ever reluctant to use their PTO — you know, the type that checks their emails every ten minutes or immediately responds to pings in their office Slack channel even when they’re on a paid vacation.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bottega-Veneta-Amazon-Earrings-Alternative.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/birthdate-co-fi.jpg><p>Sure, you may not be able to change their workhorse ways, but you can <a href=# rel=noopener>gift them with something</a> that will either gently encourage them that they need a damn vacation or, at the very least, make their office space a bit more comfortable — seeing as how they practically live there and all. With that being said, these gifts aren’t exactly enabling them to neglect life outside work (well, maybe a little, in some cases), but serving as a gentle reminder that everyone needs a little R & R sometimes. Because, job burnout is definitely a real thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/caspercontent.imgix.net/6ZMj6tYDPqQSTHTS7fdWdX/44697bd8dcde1c07695a31add4c491d7/gallery-03_2x.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41YzlwLP9DL._SL500_.jpg><p>I personally own this blanket, and it’s by far the best I’ve tried so far.
