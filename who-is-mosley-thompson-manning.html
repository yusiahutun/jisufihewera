However, he retired from the sport in 2016 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2017 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021.</p><p>Being the daughter of one of the NFL’s most well-known and talented quarterbacks makes fans curious about what Mosley has been up to. Here’s everything you need to know about her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-8_8_26_8.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=She_Was_Born_in_New_Orleans_Louisiana></span>She Was Born in New Orleans, Louisiana<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mosley Thompson Manning was born on March 31, 2011, in New Orleans, Louisiana, US. Mosley is of mixed ethnicity, Caucasian and German. The adorable young girl lives with her parents, Peyton Manning and Ashley Thompson.</p><p>Like most celebrity kids, her parents are shielding her away from the scrutiny of the spotlight. As a result, most details about her life are kept under wraps. However, we can confirm that Mosley attends one of the best schools and enjoys a life of luxury with her parents.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mosley_Thompson_Manning_Does_Not_Have_a_Career%E2%80%A6Yet></span>Mosley Thompson Manning Does Not Have a Career…Yet!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mosley Thompson Manning is still a kid, and it’s no surprise she depends on her parents for her upkeep and sustenance. She is barely a teenager who still has much growing up to do. As a result, it is unknown what career path the adorable celebrity kid will pursue.</p><p>However, she seems to have taken an interest in sports like her father. While her famous dad hung up his boots in 2016, Mosley Thompson Manning appears to be taking up the legacy as she loves sports like her father.</p><p>While she doesn’t play football, Mosley is into softball and volleyball. Since her dad is a retired NFL player, she sees him cheer on the sidelines of her games.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mosley_Thompson_Manning_Has_a_Twin_Brother></span>Mosley Thompson Manning Has a Twin Brother<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The adorable celebrity kid has a twin brother, Marshall Manning. Although Marshall and Mosley are fraternal twins, they have a close bond. The pair are avid fans of their father, and like Mosley, her twin brother is also quite athletic. Several reports claim he plays flag football and might become a footballer like his dad.</p><p>While the twins haven’t made many public appearances, they are usually seen with their father spending quality time together. Mosley enjoys attending events with her father, while Marshall likes watching the NBA games with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-8_8_24_51.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mosleys_Parents_Are_College_Sweethearts></span>Mosley’s Parents Are College Sweethearts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mosley’s parents have been a couple for over two decades. The pair first met each other through Ashley’s parent’s next-door neighbors. Peyton was just a freshman at the University of Tennessee at the time. The couple hit it off and started dating. However, they were in a long-distance relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>During this time, <a href=#>Peyton Manning</a> became Tennessee’s all-time leading passer, while Ashley earned her degree in Marketing and Finance from the University of Virginia.</p><p>The couple tied the knot on St. Patrick’s Day, March 17, 2001. Their wedding was attended by family and friends in Memphis. They have been together for over twenty years and live happily with their twins, Marshall and Mosley, in Denver, Colorado.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mosley_Thompson_Manning_Does_Not_Have_a_Social_Media_Account></span>Mosley Thompson Manning Does Not Have a Social Media Account<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While many celebrity kids her age are popular internet sensations, Mosley Thompson Manning maintains a low profile. The adorable celebrity kid enjoys every bit of childhood away from social media. Hence, she has no account on any social media platforms, including Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Mosley’s mom does not have a social media presence. However, her father has over 500k followers on his Instagram account, where he shows his love for American football and his charitable works as a philanthropist.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-8_8_27_10.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mosley_Thompson_Manning_Does_Not_Have_a_Net_Worth></span>Mosley Thompson Manning Does Not Have a Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Like most celebrity kids, Mosley doesn’t have a source of income yet.

Peyton and Ashley have a combined <a href=#>net worth</a> of $320,000,000.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans of the former NFL player are eager to see if Mosley Thompson Manning will pick up the baton where her father left off or forge a different path.
