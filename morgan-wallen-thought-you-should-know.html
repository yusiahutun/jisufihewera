The verses detail how Wallen’s life choices have worried her in the past, while the chorus describes the changed man he is today.</p><p>“What's goin' on, Mama? / Something just dawned on me / I ain't been home in some months / Been chasin'songsand women / Makin' somebad decisions / God knows I'm drinkin' toomuch / Yeah, I know you've been worrying 'bout me / You've been losin' sleep since '93,” Wallen recounts with remorse in the opening verse.</p><p>Fortunately, he’s since ditched his old ways, and there’s&nbsp;someone&nbsp;he’s thanking for that — his mom.</p><p>“I thought you should know / That all those prayers you thought you wasted on me / Must've finally made their way on through / She lets me fish whenever I want to / Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from / Still your only damn son / Can you believe I'm on the radio? Just thought you should know,”&nbsp;Wallen&nbsp;sings with profound appreciation and sincerity.</p><p>“This one’s for you mama. I know it didn’t always seem like those prayers were getting through. I hope this song is a testament to the fact that they did,” the singer writes on social media, before&nbsp;signing off&nbsp;with the song’s lyrics, “Still your only damn son, Morgan.”</p><p>The Sneedville, Tenn., native first teased this song in May of 2021. The three-minute <a href=#>Instagram</a> clip featured Wallen in a simple white T-shirt and shorts as he performed the autobiographical song on an acoustic guitar at home. It’s since amassed more than 2.7 million views.</p><p>“Thought You Should Know” is the latest release from Wallen following “Don’t Think Jesus,” which dropped in April. The hitmaker&nbsp;is currently ascending up the country charts with his single “Wasted on You” from his 2020 double album, Dangerous. Wallen&nbsp;is also featured on <a href=#>Ernest’s</a> heartbreak single, “Flower Shops,” which is Top 20-and-rising on the Mediabase Country chart.</p><p>Fans can&nbsp;catch Wallen on the road on his ongoing <a href=#>Dangerous Tour</a>. The nearly-50-date trek will conclude&nbsp;on Sept. 24 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Calif.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See Inside Morgan Wallen's Recently Sold Nashville Home</h2><a href=#>Morgan Wallen</a> has sold his Nashville home for $835,000.
