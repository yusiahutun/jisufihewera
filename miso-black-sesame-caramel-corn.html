(I put the jar of Nutella in the cabinet on notice.) A few days later, I spotted an <a href=#>ode to buffalo wings in the format of caramel popcorn</a> and sent him the link, joking that I’d probably regret it. I shouldn’t have joked. It quickly became clear that to know that this popcorn existed and to not make was an act of cruelty; why so mean, Deb? Is writing a cookbook, running a website, occasionally cooking dinner and mashing up sweet potatoes for the <a href=#>little sweet potato</a> really a higher kitchen calling than buffalo wing popcorn? And so I made it, but it looked rather sad and lonely in the bowl by itself so then I made some <a href=#>blue cheese dressing</a> on the side with celery to dip into it and, lo, it was wonderful and the story should end here.</p><p><span id=more-25711></span><br><a title="the buffalo wing popcorn that started this mess" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1533/24721010281_1acfd122fb_z.jpg alt="the buffalo wing popcorn that started this mess" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>But you don’t need me to tell you how to make Buffalo Wing Popcorn, <a href=#>Bon Appetit can do that for me</a>.

Miso is deeply fermented, salty and a little earthy with a depth of flavor that plays off the buttery-sweet-faint bitterness of caramel in a satisfyingly balanced way. With the addition of nutty black sesame seeds, I couldn’t stop eating it and found my allegiances torn. Shouldn’t all stories conclude with a winner? In this frenetic electoral season, don’t we deserve clear conclusions? Well, no, it turns out. It turns out that the answer to which one you should make is both, because why have 8 cups of happiness if you could have 16? You’ll thank yourself on Sunday, when these disappear in a breakneck cacophony of crunch.</p><p><a title="miso black sesame caramel popcorn" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1577/24814491965_40a2310f4a_z.jpg alt="miso black sesame caramel popcorn" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="miso black sesame caramel popcorn" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1707/24187634933_a8e30fdf81_z.jpg alt="miso black sesame caramel popcorn" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Chocolate Oat Crumble</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Fennel and Blood Orange Salad</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Egg Salad with Pickled Celery and Coarse Dijon</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Cheddar, Beer and Mustard Pull-Apart Bread</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Meatball Subs with Caramelized Onions</a><br><b>Six years ago:</b> <a href=#>New York Deli Rye Bread</a> and <a href=#>Best Cocoa Brownies</a><br><b>Seven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Warm Butternut Squash and Chickpea Salad</a><br><b>Eight years ago:</b> <a href=#>Matzo Ball Soup</a><br><b>Nine years ago:</b> <a href=#>Asparagus Artichoke and Shiitake Risotto</a></p><p><i>And for the other side of the world:</i><br><b>Six Months Ago:</b> <a href=#>Takeout-Style Sesame Noodles with Cucumber</a><br><b>1.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Cold Noodles with Miso Lime and Ginger</a><br><b>2.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Burst Tomato Galette with Corn and Zucchini</a><br><b>3.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Pink Lemonade Bars</a><br><b>4.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Sugar Plum Crepes with Ricotta and Honey</a></p><p><b>Miso Black Sesame Caramel Corn</b><br>Inspired in no logical way by <a href=#>Bon Appetit</a></p><p>Nonstick vegetable oil spray<br>2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil<br>1/2 cup plain popcorn kernels<br>3/4 cup granulated sugar<br>1/4 cup water<br>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, in chunks<br>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br>1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br>2 tablespoons white or red miso<br>1 tablespoon black sesame seeds</p><p>Heat oven to 300°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside. Lightly coat parchment and a the very largest bowl you own with nonstick spray.</p><p>Place 2 tablespoons oil and 2 to 3 kernels in a 3-quart or larger pot. Turn heat to medium-high and cover with a lid. When you hear these first kernels pop, add the remaining kernels and replace the lid. Using potholders, shimmy the pot around to keep the kernels moving as they pop. When several seconds pass between pops, remove from heat. Transfer to coated bowl. You should have about 8 cups popcorn.</p><p>Wipe out pot you used to pop corn. Add sugar and water to it, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, only stirring until sugar has dissolved. Boil, swirling pan around (wear potholders) until caramel is a deep amber color, which took about 8 to 9 minutes in my already-heated-from-the-popcorn pot. Remove from heat and stir in butter (mixture will hiss and bubble furiously). Return to stove, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, removing from the stove if it appears smoky sooner. Remove from heat and whisk (a whisk will best break it up) in the salt, baking soda and miso.</p><p>Quickly pour it over the prepared popcorn and toss to coat. You’ll be glad you used a gigantic bowl. I use two silicone spatulas to mix it up because it’s a messy project and popcorn will want to fall out. Whatever you do, do not pick up any caramel-coated popcorn that falls out unless you like burned fingertips. (Wait until it cools.) Coat popcorn as best as you can, but don’t fret if there are gaps.</p><p>Spread popcorn on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle sesame seeds over. Bake in oven, tossing occasionally (which will also help coat any scantily-clad popped kernels) until mixture is dry, about 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely on baking sheet, then break it up into a large bowl.</p><p>Do ahead: Keeps at its very best for 4 hours. Longer, it can be stored in containers or bags at room temperature, but if the day is humid, it might get just a tiny bit sticky. Nobody will care.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-25711 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-25711 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
