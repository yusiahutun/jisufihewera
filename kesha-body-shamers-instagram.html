But I have decided to take my life back. My freedom. My happiness. My voice. My worth. I will not just fucking be quiet and hide. Today I will say fuck it and live.”</p><p>This Instagram followed a series of what one can only assume are post-beach selfies. In them, the singer’s topless with perfectly tossed hair, proving what we’ve known all along. The beach is the answer to all our problems.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHCBlWtnbG5foLK0tMBmmaicqWLAqa3MnqmsZZmjwLWtxquYpmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./recipe-collection.html><span>←</span><span>chicken curry</span></a>
