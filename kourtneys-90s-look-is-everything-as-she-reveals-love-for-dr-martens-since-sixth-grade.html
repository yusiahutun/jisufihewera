Link in bio to shop her current must-haves.</p><p>It appears that the mother-of-four hasn’t just been wearing them on repeat lately, but since she was in just 6th grade. She jumped into the comments to let her fans know her adoration for the chunky leather boots.</p><p>In the mirror selfie, she paired the black boots with some Khaki suit trousers, a black vest top and a jacket which she left to hang off her shoulders. With minimal makeup or hair styling, Kourt added a necklace with a skull on it for detail.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Poosh (@poosh)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=fans-were-obsessed-with-her-90s-look>Fans were obsessed with her 90’s look</h2><p>In the past couple of years, Kourtney has definitely upped her style game and her outfits have been jaw-dropping. Her latest 90’s inspired look had fans feeling the same way, and they were sure to let her know in the comments.</p><p>One fan said: “Honestly, Kourtney, your style is EVERYTHING. I love the vibe of this, and the fact that you’re wearing Docs makes me love you even more!”</p><p>Another fan said, “Just reminding those who don’t know. KOURT STUDIED THIS…” as well as, “You are iconic. What a look.

One person said, “Vegan but wearing leather Kourt?”</p><p>Another said, “The link in the picture doesn’t bring up vegan Docs…” However, many fans were quick to defend Kourtney as they reminded others that many Doc Marten’s are vegan and it is likely that she is wearing the faux leather boots.</p><p>Dr Marten’s now come as vegan friendly, therefore, it is likely <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kourt </a>is repping the fake leather boots.
