Symptoms can be mild in some, and in others more extreme causing severe disability.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>MS affects 2.3 million people worldwide - including around one million in the US, and 100,000 in the UK.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is more than twice as common in women as it is in men. A person is usually diagnosed in their 20s and 30s.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The condition is more commonly diagnosed in people of European ancestry.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The cause isn't clear. There may be genes associated with it, but it is not directly hereditary. Smoking and low vitamin D levels are also linked to MS.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Symptoms include fatigue, difficulty walking,&nbsp;vision problems, bladder problems, numbness or tingling, muscle stiffness and spasms, problems with balance and co-ordination, and&nbsp;problems with thinking, learning and planning.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The majority of sufferers will have episodes of symptoms which go away and come back, while some have ones which get gradually worse over time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Symptoms can be managed with medication and therapy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The condition shortens the average life expectancy by around five to 10 years.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhrbmlshHiBjoycpaWRYo%2BtrcirZJqcnZ7BtHnHmqmdZZ2kwamx0WaYpqGUYpqUecOimKCmn6i2tHnCqK2eqqNilK2tzKisq6tdjLyusc1mkJ6ZomLEprrTZpmloaOos7a4jKmpnp%2BelrukxYyuq62domKxpsLArKuarJmku2%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./selena-gomez-and-benny-blancos-body-language-shows-relationship-is-heading-in-a-positive-direction.html><span>←</span><span>Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco's body language shows relationship is heading in a 'positive direction</span></a>
