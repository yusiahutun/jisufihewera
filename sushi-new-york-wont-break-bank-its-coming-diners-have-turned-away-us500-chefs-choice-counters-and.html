This market transformation “is one of the reasons we have decided to move on to the next phase”, she says."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Earlier this summer, chef Eji Ichimura returned to New York with a US$425 menu.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Later this year, Sushi Sho, whose Hawaii restaurant is one of the best places for cured fish in the country, will open its first New York outpost. But the field will be a little thinner than it was.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Sushi Ginza Onodera entered the US market in New York seven years ago, the city’s omakase scene was just beginning to blossom.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why vegan sushi is booming, and an LA-based Japanese chef leading the trend</span></p></a></h3>Dining enthusiasts were clamouring to get into the West Village spot Nakazawa opened by <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</span></a> alum Daisuke Nakazawa, where the omakase was going for US$150.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, the Big Apple has welcomed no less than 14 sophisticated counters – many built from wood imported from Japan, accented with artisan pottery and equipped with just a handful of seats.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, a meal starts at US$300, with the top-tier places running closer to US$500. That is not counting drinks beyond water, or tax and tip.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That is also not taking into account Masa, the leader in expense-account sushi which currently charges US$950, exclusive of drinks and before tax, to sit at the counter, without knowing if chef Masa Takayama will be there to serve you.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is no surprise, then, that diners are beginning to balk at paying the equivalent of a laptop for a two-hour meal for two.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/11/0eeb83d6-5143-4942-9b1e-69f2a997ab72_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sophia Park, co-owner of Taru, says the potential oversaturation of high-end omakase is “a valid concern”. When the Sushi on Me pop-up finishes at the end of August, she plans to use the former Kotaru space to host meals from rising talent, with pricing that reflects the different concepts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But she says the goal of these forthcoming engagements will be to offer a great meal and “provide value”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Joshua Foulquier, co-owner of Sushi Noz on the Upper East Side, where the menu goes for US$495, agrees that the high-end counter scene in New York is getting crowded. He is “starting to see some dilution in the market”, as places shut their doors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/11/fd2f4389-3bf6-4b26-af09-040b4e5aa6ac_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Foulquier attributes the high price of a Noz meal to the cost of flying in top-of-the-line Japanese seafood multiple times a week. He says most high-end counters have only 8 or 10 seats with a maximum of 20 guests a night.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While most restaurants depend on liquor sales to hike up check averages, the customers at sushi bars typically do not drink much. “The margins are impossibly thin,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Small omakase counters rarely order ingredients in bulk, he adds. Sushi Noz, for example, receives most of its products daily on overnight flights from Japan.</p>Foulquier says he pays “about US$350 per pound for <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">abalone</span></a>, unagi and some other key ingredients”. Staffing also contributes to the cost: the owner estimates there are “two and a half employees to every one diner” at Sushi Noz.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/12/f7c9b886-1cb9-4b5f-9203-f305df4ea313_c531a397.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To expand their audience, earlier this year Foulquier and chef Nozomu Abe transformed their nearby speciality fish and Japanese fruit shop Noz Market into a dual-concept space with a 10-seat counter offering a US$140 omakase, in addition to a small stand-up bar that serves three hand rolls for US$25.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Charging significantly less, Noz Market serves as a “great entry point to the world of high-end omakase without the intimidating price tag”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other operators have decided to avoid the pricey sushi path altogether. Linda Wang operates seven casual sushi counters whose menus are all under US$110.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She has watched the explosion of high-priced openings; the US$400-plus meals are “insane” and “not feasible for most”, she says. It is the reason she chose to focus on counter experiences that a wider audience could afford.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She debuted her first location, Ume, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 2018, after the start of New York’s extravagant omakase wave. She has followed up with six outlets in the past 18 months: Sanyuu, Thirteen Water, Sekai, Sushi Nikko, Shinn West and Shinn East.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wanted an omakase-quality sushi restaurant that people like me – at that time 23 years old and fresh out of college – could afford,” she says, noting that the price of a chef’s-choice sushi meal used to hover around US$200 but is now double that. The cost, she says, “is just not realistic for most people”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9of3R8lm5saKulqLWqec2ermaxn6e4bsPOp6tmmqKarqx5wZqlpGWZqcBur86moKefXZm2r7HRrGShmaaaerXB0aecnWWRrK66edSsbGloXZi1prLSZpqhp5mYsm6vzq6lrZ2iqHqiusM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eric-stoltz-html.html><span>←</span><span>See Eric Stoltz Play Marty McFly All Wrong</span></a>
