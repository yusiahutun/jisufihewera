The couple divorced shortly after the teenage bride accused Muhammad Fakhry of kidnapping her. Pinot, now 27 years old, ran as a legislative candidate in the Indonesian elections on Wednesday.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Observers say royal multicultural marriages have as much to do with the Southeast Asian nation’s colourful colonial history – which included Portuguese, Dutch and British colonialists – as well as the modern racial dynamics within the multicultural and multi-religious country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But these unions, while largely accepted, have not been without controversy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the earliest instances of the multicultural marriages was the 21st Johor Sultan, Abu Bakar, who married Cecilia Catherine Lange, the half-Balinese daughter of a Danish trader. The couple met in Singapore in 1870, fell in love and married – against the convention demanding racial purity back then.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lange, who converted to Islam and became known as Zubaidah, had a son – Ibrahim of Johor, who was often described as an Anglophile. One of his wives was Scottish doctor Helen Bartholomew.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Watch the throne: what does the king’s dramatic abdication mean for Malaysia</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dating back to the colonial era (1824-1963) when then Malaya was part of the British Empire, Malaysian royals were encouraged to adopt British customs and traditions, according to Saad Salman, a Canadian journalist and self-described “royal watcher”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This led to some quite high-profile marriages between European women and some sultans and maharajas – which were discouraged by the colonial elites, but generally accepted by the population,” said Salman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Westerners would have an easier time converting to Islam, said Aaron W. Hughes, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Rochester. “In terms of Islam, it would be much easier for someone from the West since they would be familiar with the basic Judeo-Christian themes that Islam continues: God, creation, prophecy, the Day of Judgement, and so on,” he said. “A Buddhist or a Hindu, for example, would have a much more difficult time grasping such issues.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Malaysia’s next king: Islam’s defender, political tightrope walker (just ask Mahathir Mohamad)</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under British rule, Malaysia’s ethnic groups were categorised under Malay, Chinese and Indian, a practice which continues till today. While Malaysian society adheres to tenets of multiculturalism, academics say the rigid divide between these groups have made intermarrying less common, especially among the elites.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Despite such high levels of racialisation, many Malaysians – ordinary citizens, members of the political and economic elites, opposition politicians, religious leaders, intellectuals, artists and devotees of popular culture – claim to be anti-racist and are often critical of the prevalent racial assumptions. [But] the more honest and insightful among them … are worried by the hold of such racial assumptions over their own consciousness as well,” wrote the late scholar Joel S Kahn, in his article The Making and Unmaking of a Malay Race, in the 2005 International Journal of Social and Cultural Practice.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Malaysia’s reform-minded ‘young guns’, from Nurul Izzah to Khairy Jamaluddin, take aim at race-based politics</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Malaysia has long ties, particularly through colonialism, with Europe which have led to these marriages, said Salman. “But there are examples of Malaysian royals marrying people from other parts of Asia, the Americas, and Australia too.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For example, there was the case of the 1981 marriage of Australian former ballet dancer-turned-reporter Jacqueline Pascarl to Malaysian royal Dato Raja Kamarul Bahrin of Terengganu state, which ended in divorce, and even led to charges of child abduction. Pascarl had accused the prince of taking their two children away from her.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Looking at examples from the past, many foreigners have not been able to cope with the change, and some of the marriages between royals and foreigners have led to divorceCanadian journalist Saad Salman</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As for the actual conversion process to Islam, Hughes the academic said the process was simple. “All one has to do is utter a statement saying that they believe that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is His messenger,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Obviously they would have to say it with the proper intention for it to be valid. A non-Muslim can thus become a Muslim very easily. All they would need to do, at least in theory, is give up alcohol, pork, and begin to pray the requisite five times a day. If they wanted to learn Arabic to read the Koran and other texts, they could. But they do not have to.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, learning the nuances of the Malay-Muslim culture is a different story altogether, said Hughes. The foreign spouses would probably have a more difficult time learning the ins and outs of Malay culture, of which Islam is just one part.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even for Meghan Markle, becoming the Duchess of Sussex resulted in a big lifestyle change for her, as there were many differences between American and British cultures despite the shared language, said Salman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, becoming a member of a Malay royal family calls for an even bigger change. “The biggest barrier would be language, despite many Malaysians speaking English, as it is instrumental in learning the culture and customs of a country,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Looking at examples from the past, many foreigners have not been able to cope with the change, and some of the marriages between royals and foreigners have led to divorce,” said Salman. “However, there are many marriages that have proved to be a success, and there is no doubt that with some advice from their peers, and love and support from their spouse and new family, the newcomer will easily adjust into their new lifestyle.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZMCwr8ieq7JnkafBqq%2FLnmZsaGBrhHiFjrCfsmWRp7JuucClmLKrmZa7brzRoqWcnaNiubDCxGadqKqVnrSvecGroJ2dow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./burt-lancaster-and-susan-martin.html><span>←</span><span>Burt Lancaster and Susan Martin</span></a>
