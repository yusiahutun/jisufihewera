Staring at a plaque dedicated to Princess Diana, I’m imagining what it must have been like for Britain’s Prince William, who was just 15 years old when his mother died in a car crash on August 31, 1997.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Twenty-five years later, Diana looms so large over London that many tourists follow her trail across the British capital. The Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Walk, 11km (7 miles) long, takes in four of London’s eight royal parks and is charted by 90 metal plaques planted in footpaths.</p>Being Australian and the same age as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Prince William</span></a>, I knew Diana from reading articles in the gossip magazines my mother bought each week. Those stories were typically critical or controversial, and eventually this rumour mill contributed to Diana’s death.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A 2008 British inquest into the crash found it was caused by the reckless driving of both Diana’s chauffeur and the paparazzi vehicles pursuing them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/24/7b9771c2-5c14-4be4-a8fc-919bc6597f0a_987ef80b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She is buried at Althorp Park, her childhood home 100km north of London. Yet Diana’s spirit seems to illuminate London’s Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, where I stand in earnest frame of mind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/24/83749e49-e0a0-49e5-b558-1000f56ee0a0_97202600.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fortunately my solemnity is short-lived. The surroundings – two of the prettiest urban green spaces in Europe – elevate my mood.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shaped like a figure of eight, the Diana memorial walk extends beyond Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park to neighbouring St James’s Park and Green Park. The plaques point the way. Designed by British sculptor Alec Peever, each is embellished with a rose.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As well as being a traditional emblem of England, this flower will forever be linked to Diana thanks to Elton John’s 1997 tribute to the princess, a re-recording of Candle in the Wind that begins with the lyric: “Goodbye, England’s rose”. The record became the highest-selling single of the past 50 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/24/90f3e143-30af-4ac0-9f56-9367231cdc9b_89bc71d9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beds of roses decorate St James’s Park, where I first join the trail at its eastern end. This walk was launched in 2000 along with the Diana Memorial Playground, in Kensington Gardens.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As explained on England’s Royal Parks website, these projects “celebrate the Princess’s affection for the open spaces around her home in Kensington Palace, and her love of children”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">She made the ‘fairy princess dress’ that Princess Diana wore to get married</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Diana could occasionally be seen walking through these tranquil spaces, albeit flanked by security. By following her trail, I am able not just to absorb the natural splendour, but also admire many historic buildings linked to Diana.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/24/b231811f-4bf0-417a-bff8-cd143232778c_46aa3fd5.jpg>St James’s Palace, north of the park of the same name, is laced with the brightest and darkest of Diana memories. It was here, in 1981, that she waited in an ivory silk gown with a 7.5 metre (25 feet)-long sequin-encrusted train before her <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">wedding to Charles</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This red-brick Tudor building was also where Diana’s body lay in state for days, in the palace’s chapel, before her funeral.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Further west, through Green Park, I glimpse Clarence House and Spencer House. The former is a stately royal residence where Diana lived for a period after her engagement to Charles. The latter, 150 metres to the north, was the London residence of Diana’s family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/24/c6d3cff6-694d-4b9e-b1b3-80f0dd202f61_11056a76.jpg>Heading in the same direction, I soon encounter the hulking <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Buckingham Palace</span></a>, its front gates swarmed by photo-seeking tourists. Although this is the headquarters of Britain’s royal family, and home of her mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth, Diana grew uncomfortable in its opulent interiors.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The princess alleged in interviews that she received little support from members of the royal household, including her husband, whom she divorced in 1996.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From Green Park the trail goes beneath the towering Wellington Arch, past the colourful Hyde Park Rose Garden and the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain towards her sanctuary, Kensington Palace and Gardens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/29/54e4239f-86c9-47b8-9efa-4012121181f1_12394d04.jpg>She lived here for 16 years until her death. It was where she nursed her two sons, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">William and Harry</span></a>, and watched them grow into adolescence.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tourists may explore the landscaped gardens and lavish interior of this palace, but I walk on to the playground dedicated to Diana. I picture her standing there, listening to what I can hear – the laughter of children frolicking.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is an uplifting end to a tour of Diana’s London.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmpwaWhhbHyxvsinmp6ro2Kxqq3Nmqpmnp%2BkwbTAxKmqZq%2BRobhuwMerpq6fmGK5sLrDqKVmqJGowQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-would-be-tupac-shakurs-estate-worth-today-in-2024-exploring-his-fortune-and-wealth-at-the-time-of-his-death-1272229.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Would Be Tupac Shakurs Estate Worth Today In 2024?
