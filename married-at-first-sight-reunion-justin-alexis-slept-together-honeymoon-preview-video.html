Justin says, “In her eyes, it wasn’t very long. In my eyes, I’m like you penetrate. I penetrate. And that’s what it was. Whatever she wants to call it, we had sex the first night of the honeymoon. We had sex on the third night of the honeymoon. Like, we orgasmed.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Alexis gives a look that says maybe that was not the case. “It sounded like you did,” Justin tells Alexis. There’s an awkward silence between them. “I did,” Justin admits.&nbsp;Alexis replies, “If that’s the story Justin wants, then I’m fine with that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Married-At-First-Sight-Reunion-lifetime-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Alexis started out this journey ready to commit to one person for the rest of her life, according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lifetime bio</a>.

He’s a giver and a doer; with the help of the experts, he knows he will put the Married At First Sight experiment to good use and be the best husband possible.
