“In the past, there was something about its being a job, being commissioned. Now, I can write as I want,” he says.
Tanikawa is among Japan’s most famous modern poets, and a master of free verse on the everyday.
He has more than a hundred poetry books published."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

With titles like To Live, Listen and Grass, his poems are stark, rhythmical but conversational, defying elaborate traditional literary styles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">William Elliott, who has translated Tanikawa for years, compares his place in Japanese poetic history to how T.S. Eliot marked the beginning of a new era in English poetry.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Artist Louise Bonnet on her absurdist human figures on show in Hong Kong</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tanikawa is also a reputed translator, having translated Charles Schulz’ Peanuts comic strip into Japanese since the 1970s. He demonstrated his ear for the poetic in the colloquial with finesse, choosing “yare yare” for “good grief”, transcending the lifestyle differences of East and West in the universal world of children and animals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He was more a poet or a philosopher,” he says of Schulz.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tanikawa has translated many others’ works, including Mother Goose, as well as Maurice Sendak and Leo Lionni. In turn, his works have been widely translated, including into Chinese and European languages.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tanikawa’s poem Two Billion Light-Years of Solitude catapulted him to stardom in the early 1950s. Tanikawa had his eyes on the cosmos and Earth’s spot in the universe, years before Gabriel Garcia Marquez wrote the magical realism classic, One Hundred Years of Solitude.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/03/929e544b-b843-4024-b30f-57a952e35892_d61501fb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tanikawa was always in demand, the darling of poetry readings around the world, a rare example of a poet who effortlessly crossed over to commercialism without compromising his art.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But poetry used to be a job – his profession, his daily work.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tanikawa is the lyricist for the Japanese theme song for Osamu Tezuka’s TV animated series Astro Boy. He also wrote the script for the narration of Kon Ichikawa’s documentary of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A popular author of children’s picture books, he is often featured in textbooks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/03/de95e3ec-16b8-4b3a-8c5e-fa3cf0f17a93_da72f2b5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He swears he doesn’t have “projects” any more because of his age, which has made walking and going out more difficult. But in the same breath he says he is collaborating with his musician son Kensaku Tanikawa, who lives next door, on what they call “Piano Twitter”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He has already written dozens of poems to go with the score.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Married and divorced three times – to a poet, an actress and an illustrator – Tanikawa stresses he was changing with age, noting 90 felt much older than 80, and he was getting forgetful.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet he appeared on a recent sunny afternoon totally comfortable with social media and everyday technology, although he used a magnifying glass to make out fine print. He was curious about new movies, including what might be on Netflix. He likes eating cookies, he says, looking more like a mischievous child than the great-grandfather that he is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/03/b84b6069-edfd-428c-b3f4-c766dbf890d4_2a5e1063.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He hopes to die as his father did, in his sleep after a night of partying, at 94.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am more curious about where I go when I die,” he says. “It’s a different world, right? Of course, I don’t want pain. I don’t want to die after major surgery or anything. I just want to die, all of a sudden.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR9l2lqbWlfnbJuwNGapaykkamypXnPnpinraSoeri%2Bzq2cZqSpp7akv4yaqq2qn2KvsMWMmqWdZZOkurGt0Z6bZqyj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charles-melton-prosthetic-may-december-sex-scene.html><span>←</span><span>Charles Melton Details Wearing Prosthetic For 9 Hours For 'May December' Sex Scene</span></a>
