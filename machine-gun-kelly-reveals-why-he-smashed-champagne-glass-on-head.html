Yeah, I didn't have a fork. So I just clinked it on my head."</p><p>"You know what? In medicine, they call that asking for it," Meyers joked in response, to which Kelly laughed and noted, "Yeah, so I had a serious case of that last night."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Meyers then went on to ask Kelly about his sold-out show at the New York City arena.</p><p>As the "Bloody Valentine" singer went to respond, he put his hands up to rub his face, before he remembered his injury.</p><p>"Sorry. I keep forgetting I have this," MGK admitted, gesturing towards his wound, "but I'm a hand talker."</p><p>The glass incident went down on Tuesday night at Catch in New York City. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>', at the afterparty, the "Emo Girl" rocker said into a microphone: "I dont give a f---, bro. I don't give a s---," and then smashed the flute on his forehead, sending pieces of broken glass into the air.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, Kelly posted a video of the bloody moment on his Instagram Stories. Alongside the clip he wrote, "and this is when things turned..."</p><p>He also shared a series of photos from his time in NYC for his concert on his Instagram profile. The post included several shots of MGK with his bloody-dripping gory wound on his face. The punk rocker hilariously captioned the post, "NYC you're my bloody valentine ü©∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•."</p><a id=gallery-link-319b9905-2821-4e16-8737-ac26eba29476 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:319b9905-2821-4e16-8737-ac26eba29476 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:7d847caf-484b-4287-90b7-e3faf0034104 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ba/4by3/2021/09/13/bafa5c291d814b549dda2b1e864e2e1b_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j29mbGhfoq6ktMinnGafpaN6rLHLpbBmqpWrsqK40mauobFdnbJuv8yaqqGdlGKwqa3MqZigppVitK2t0qxkqKZdnbKisI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-brook-looks-high-spirits-former-fianc-david-mcintosh-prepares-ex-beach-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Kelly Brook looks in high spirits as former fianc David Mcintosh prepares for on Ex On The Beach</span></a>
