<a href=../../last-friday-night-video-katy-p-html.html></a>
And so what is likely the last video off Katy Perry’s indomitable Teenage Dream arrives — mouth gear, continuity issues, Rebecca Black, and all. As has been teased pretty hard for the past few weeks, in the video for Song of Summer contender “Last Friday Night (TGIF),” Perry playsKathy Beth Terry, a nerd in the Sixteen Candles mold who has huge glasses, a brace face, and just threw a rager.

[Note: This recipe got some fresh photos in 2019.]
I recently realized that I didn’t have a single recipe for a whole roasted chicken on this site which seemed wrong somehow, coming from a nice Jewish girl such as myself. I know the real reason I don’t — which is that I don’t like 75 percent of the roasted chicken I eat (not yours, of course; promise!). Mostly, I find the pieces too big, the meat overcooked and the entire thing kind of like pressed sawdust… um, not that I need to learn to form an opinion or something.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>DWP Announces The Dates, Lineup For Aftershock 2021</h2><time>Aug 9, 2024</time>
