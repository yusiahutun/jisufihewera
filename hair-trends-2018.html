Model Grace Elizabeth's hair was pulled into a super-high ponytail, decorated with three Versace brooches, and then pounds of fake hair were added in for the sky-high cascading effect. The look was reminiscent of the latest Valentino runway, where model Kaia Gerber stormed the catwalk in hair so voluminous you could practically see it from the ISS.</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">2</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Royal Bows</h2><img alt="Suit, Hairstyle, Formal wear, Interaction, White-collar worker, Gesture, Fashion, Event, Outerwear, Dress, " data-cy=slide-image-2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-william-duke-of-cambridge-and-catherine-duchess-of-news-photo-1066097998-1543432347.jpg title="Suit, Hairstyle, Formal wear, Interaction, White-collar worker, Gesture, Fashion, Event, Outerwear, Dress, " width=768 height=959 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kate Middleton basically invented the royal ponytail. The humble hairstyle, once thought to be too athletic and sporty for red carpets and royal families, has been a staple of the Duchess for years. Her version is always polished and perfect, but in late 2018, Middleton took her ponytail one step further. Instead of simply pulling her back with an elastic or wrapping the base with a strand of hair, Middleton has been wearing a black velvet elastic affixed with a bow.</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">3</span><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">The Claw</h2><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I love the way that something that's been around and has a funny connotation can come back," hairstylist Guido Palau said backstage at Alexander Wang of the designer's claw clip. If you remember the clips from the first time around—and perhaps still have a few of your own—Palau wants to make you feel really, really old: "Also, you've got to remember, lots of girls probably don't remember what the banana clip is. There's an 18 or 17-year-old girl, they don't know it has a funny connotation to it. They may just think it's super cool to do that in their hair."</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">4</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Baby Bangs</h2><img alt="Hair, Fashion model, Hairstyle, Fashion, Long hair, Black hair, Beauty, Lip, Brown hair, Fashion show, " data-cy=slide-image-4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1044509034-1-1544742118.jpg title="Hair, Fashion model, Hairstyle, Fashion, Long hair, Black hair, Beauty, Lip, Brown hair, Fashion show, " width=1710 height=2565 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Baby bangs—that is, fringe cut intentionally shorter than your eyebrows—have been trending since the beginning of the year. But it appears that the polarizing haircut trend is here to stay, at least until the end of spring 2019. Model Kaia Gerber hit the Miu Miu spring 2019 runway in Paris wearing one of the boldest baby bangs looks we've seen this year.</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">5</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Super Ornate</h2><img alt="Blond, Human body, Muscle, Abdomen, Chest, Trunk, Dance, Tradition, " data-cy=slide-image-5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-955740776-1525731299.jpg title="Blond, Human body, Muscle, Abdomen, Chest, Trunk, Dance, Tradition, " width=768 height=1169 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hairstylist Renda Attia was behind Jasmine Sanders's breathtaking braid at this year's Met Gala. The braid was center-parted and plaited down the center of her back. Small red roses were pinned everywhere down the braid, while pink and red velvet ribbon were wrapped around various sections of hair. When you look closely, you can also see that gold ribbon and tiny pearls strung on gold wire were wrapped around section of hair too. There was a lot going on in the hair look—and it will probably take Sanders four hours to unravel—but the end result is nothing short of jaw-dropping.</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">6</span><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Nirvana Blonde</h2><img alt="Earrings, Lip, Hairstyle, Forehead, Eyebrow, Eyelash, Jewellery, Fashion accessory, Body jewelry, Beauty, " data-cy=slide-image-6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-877586920-1513704421.jpg title="Earrings, Lip, Hairstyle, Forehead, Eyebrow, Eyelash, Jewellery, Fashion accessory, Body jewelry, Beauty, " width=4928 height=3280 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you're going to dye your hair one color this year, make it Nirvana Blonde. Hairstylists Nikki Lee and Riawna Capri dubbed the soft platinum hue they gave to Selena Gomez after the legendary Kurt Cobain. It has a lived-in effect from the moment you leave the salon, and it's easier on your roots, too.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">7</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">The Boyish Bang</h2><img alt="Hair, Face, Hairstyle, Eyebrow, Chin, Beauty, Bangs, Head, Bob cut, Fashion, " data-cy=slide-image-7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-2-48-19-pm-1513712923.png title="Hair, Face, Hairstyle, Eyebrow, Chin, Beauty, Bangs, Head, Bob cut, Fashion, " width=642 height=968 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At Moschino, Prada, Fendi, and Tom Ford, models stormed the runways in faux-cuts and choppy bangs that had a decidedly boyish quality to them.</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">8</span><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Bubble Up</h2><img alt="Hair, Hairstyle, Beauty, Ear, Chignon, Black hair, Hair accessory, Neck, Long hair, Electric blue, " data-cy=slide-image-8 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-12-34-24-pm-1513704889.png title="Hair, Hairstyle, Beauty, Ear, Chignon, Black hair, Hair accessory, Neck, Long hair, Electric blue, " width=966 height=720 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Leave it to Rihanna to dream up one of the coolest hairstyles for 2018. At her spring Fenty Puma show, models walked the motocross-inspired runway with their ponytails wrapped in elastic neon string. Wrapped in sections and tied at random, the string created perfectly imperfect bubbled sections along the length of the tail.</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">9</span><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Wavy Bang</h2><img alt="Hair, Face, Hairstyle, Brown hair, Lip, Long hair, Hair coloring, Eyebrow, Beauty, Black hair, " data-cy=slide-image-9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-4-29-29-pm-1513718985.png title="Hair, Face, Hairstyle, Brown hair, Lip, Long hair, Hair coloring, Eyebrow, Beauty, Black hair, " width=884 height=662 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Instagram</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The answer to whether or not you should get bangs is always yes—especially in 2018. Take a cue from Victoria's Secret Angel Taylor Hill and try a messy, choppy fringe paired with your long natural hair texture.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">10</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Loud & Clear</h2><img alt="Tradition, " data-cy=slide-image-10 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-2-50-23-pm-1513713042.png title="Tradition, " width=770 height=968 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Instagram</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you pick up one hair accessory this season, make it something acrylic. At Chanel, models wore clear plastic tubes fastened over their low ponytails. The look is unexpectedly fun and chic.</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">11</span><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Double Barette</h2><img alt="Hair, Face, Eyebrow, Hairstyle, Nose, Skin, Beauty, Lip, Cheek, Chin, " data-cy=slide-image-11 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-2-31-55-pm-1513711944.png title="Hair, Face, Eyebrow, Hairstyle, Nose, Skin, Beauty, Lip, Cheek, Chin, " width=1510 height=756 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All hair types and textures can try this trend: two barrettes of your choice fastened parallel just above each temple. We love the gold ones at the Versace show, but a classic bobby pin done in a metallic finish works just as well.</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">12</span><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Going Retro</h2><img alt="Hair, Face, Hairstyle, Chin, Hair coloring, Bangs, Blond, Eyebrow, Bob cut, Lip, " data-cy=slide-image-12 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-4-18-05-pm-1513718312.png title="Hair, Face, Hairstyle, Chin, Hair coloring, Bangs, Blond, Eyebrow, Bob cut, Lip, " width=906 height=904 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For haircut and style inspiration in the coming year you should look to years past. Ends are rolled-under or flipped out, and cuts are blunter than ever, harkening back to the early '90s in the most fashion-forward way.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">13</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Go Big</h2><img alt="Hair, Hairstyle, Afro, Jheri curl, Black hair, Beauty, Ringlet, Lip, S-curl, Long hair, " data-cy=slide-image-13 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-the-list-best-beauty-looks-of-the-year-uzo-aduba-gettyimages-848651808-1512514120.jpg title="Hair, Hairstyle, Afro, Jheri curl, Black hair, Beauty, Ringlet, Lip, S-curl, Long hair, " width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you have natural curls or texture—don't just wear them, flaunt them. One of the biggest beauty moments of last year was Uzo Aduba's fantastic voluminous curls. Use a few key styling products like mousse, hairspray, or dry shampoo to take your natural texture to new heights.</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">14</span><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Return of the Scrunchie</h2><img alt="Hair, Hairstyle, Hair coloring, Long hair, Blond, Hair accessory, Brown hair, Fashion accessory, Neck, Hair tie, " data-cy=slide-image-14 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-scrunchie-runway-1510087096.jpg title="Hair, Hairstyle, Hair coloring, Long hair, Blond, Hair accessory, Brown hair, Fashion accessory, Neck, Hair tie, " width=980 height=490 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The humble scrunchie made a return to the runways this season at the Mansur Gavriel show. By the end of 2017, celebrity hairstylist Jen Atkin had released her own line of fuzzy scrunchies. In 2018, it's safe to say the polarizing accessory is back for good. The 2018 version should be worn and fastened with purpose and done in a luxe finish like silk or velvet.</p><span class="css-1bmcpr3 eutn2uj4">15</span><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Braids Are Back</h2><img alt="Hair, Hairstyle, Blond, Hair coloring, Long hair, Layered hair, Brown hair, Human, Step cutting, Surfer hair, " data-cy=slide-image-15 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-5-16-06-pm-1513721791.png title="Hair, Hairstyle, Blond, Hair coloring, Long hair, Layered hair, Brown hair, Human, Step cutting, Surfer hair, " width=904 height=902 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">/Instagram</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Get your Youtube braid tutorials at the ready. If it's been a few years since you learned how to weave a plait, you'll need to sharpen your skills for 2018. Braids of all kinds have made a comeback on the runway (including four-strand and fishtail). Our favorite way to wear the trend? A long, low, and loose fishtail, like the one at the Chanel Hamburg pre-fall show. Finish it off with a glitzy accessory fastened right at the nape. With that kind of styling, nobody could accuse you of wearing a 2010 boho braid.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p><h6 class="css-1qmam5g e1a8voem2"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-0 e1a8voem1">Watch Next</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h6 class="css-4iho3 e1a8voem0">&nbsp;</h6></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Harper's Bazaar Beauty" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/gettyimages-1501798216-64b8495a41951.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqGZmad8qH2TbWlxaGFtfKmtyKtkraqVo7G0eZFpaHFn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gabby-barrett-cade-foehner-wedding.html><span>←</span><span>Gabby Barrett Marries Cade Foehner</span></a>
