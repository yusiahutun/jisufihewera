The footage shows the 22-year-old laughing and playing in the water, in no apparent difficulty.</p><p>"This is what life is all about," Ragland says in the heartbreaking footage, standing in waist deep water with his pals. "Being with brothers and sisters, we living life. We made a decision to live a lifestyle that most people don't live. This is only the beginning... this is only the beginning."</p><p>But at some stage he went under water and never came up.</p><p>Two years later, his parents received a call from Aloha. After being told about the accident by park rangers, the vlogger tracked down Ragland's mother and father online, and sent them the camera with the intact SD card, which contained their son's final moments.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:05c5eb21-57c6-5da2-90cf-d9c37fef0e1b data-container-ref=toofab:article:e22cf7ba-201a-5a93-83ce-bc0d778fffad data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/26/5by4/2019/07/22/26022441c65e5b378a73823a1fb4ad98_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dad Killed on Beach When Freak Wave Breaks His Neck</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I was going through the footage and I said, 'Oh my God, this is the guy,'" Aloha recalls of his astonishing discovery.</p><p>"I'm glad I found it, personally, because I try to do the right thing and get the item back to the rightful owner," he said.</p><p>Praising Aloha for his efforts, Ragland's mother Robin said watching the footage was like an "out of body experience" — although they hadn't yet been able to bring themselves to watch the entire thing yet.</p><p>His mother also revealed that not long after her son's death, the park ranger sent a package to her that was supposed to contain footage someone else had videoed of her son on the day he drowned; when she opened it she found that thumb drive had been stolen.</p><p>"He was an amazing young man.
