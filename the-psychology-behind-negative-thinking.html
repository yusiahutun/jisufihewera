There have been numerous studies showing that we are bombarded daily with the cavalry of thoughts which often creates unwanted confusion, trouble, <a href=#>stress </a>and frustration in our mind as well as chaos in our physical world. In this article, you are going to explore all the psychological aspects and proven techniques to overcome such negative thoughts also known as “distorted thinking”. I strongly believe you will develop a mindful career, growth and <a href=#>relationship</a> after having a glimpse of this article.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>What are negative thoughts?</h4><p>Negative thoughts are the component of cognitive distortions and automatic thoughts. In which a person starts to see the negative view of all the things. There are mainly three main categories of distorted thinking also known as the negative triad:</p><ul><li>Negative ideas about oneself,</li><li>The future and</li><li>The world.</li></ul><p>Negative thoughts are the sign of stress, anxiety, <a href=#>low self-esteem</a>, frustration, <a href=#>depression</a> and loneliness. However, these signs sometimes lead to psychological disorders, for<a href=#> Schizophrenia</a>, Generalised anxiety disorders (GAD ) and <a href=#>obsessive-compulsive disorder</a> (OCD).</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>The Science of Negative Thought</h4><p>In the 1970s, US Psychologist Aaron Beck gave a theory on negative thought patterns which he labelled as “negative schemas” which cause negative<a href=#> emotions</a>. In his book “ Cognitive Therapy” he stated negative thoughts as cognitive distortions and negative thinking as distorted thinking. According to him, our thoughts are the result of our feelings and these feelings create a person’s thinking which affects their mood and health. An endless loop makes us fall into this and traps our minds.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Concepts, Types & Techniques</a></strong></p><p>Unfortunately, negative thoughts worsen the way we feel and think and also reduce our capability to work. Another psychologist Leigh Goggin stated that – “negative interpretation bias”. It is a factor in the continuation of a depressed mood, which lasts with poor mental health and leading <a href=#>anxiety</a>, depression, overthinking and lower self-esteem of ones.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>The Dark Side of Negativity</h4><p>Sometimes, we take it lightly and don’t recognize easily our negative thinking as this thinking goes into our unconscious brain and becomes a part of our regular <a href=#>behaviour</a>. It acts as an addiction and becomes very hard to get rid of and overcome which lasts with a mental disease. And it also lasts out reasoning ability to think and create new things. That’s why, it’s very important first to label your feelings (thoughts) and deal with them intelligently and if required get support from your nearest psychologist or psychiatrist. Otherwise, it will cause a mental disorder soon and we will miss our beautiful life and seeing transparency into it because, as we know ‘negativity breeds negativity’.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>Toxic Positivity: Why being “Positive” is not always the solution?</a></strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Law of Attraction</h4><p>As we all know the science of the <a href=#>law of attraction</a>-“we attract merely those thoughts more often which we think or feel repeatedly”.So, it’s very important to keep an eye on our thinking or feelings, secretly day by day to recognize and manage them for a mindful life. Here’s a famous quote – “how we think we become”.

So quickly.</li><p>Despite saying :</p><li>No, I will.</li><li>No, I can’t.</li><li>No, I don’t.</li><ul><li><strong>Pause and labelling:</strong> From time to time it becomes very important to pause our <a href=#>thinking</a> and break its flow to have more clarity and transparency in our thinking as well as rewiring it with new thoughts and creativity. labelling means knowing your feelings or thinking intensity, date, time, cause of arousal and reason behind arousing.

Repeat the same process whenever any kind of negative thinking occurs in your mind further in future. In this way, you would able to label your thinking and manage it soon and this can also help your psychiatrist to diagnose your problem accurately and easily.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Meditation: </strong>Meditation and <a href=#>mindfulness </a>are the best techniques to manage negative thoughts as well as turn them into positive ones. 15 minutes of daily meditation and focusing on the present merely can change your mind and processing of thoughts.
