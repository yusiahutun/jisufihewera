There wasn’t a lot of use of her children in the media,” William J. Mann, author of How to Be a Movie Star: Elizabeth Taylor in Hollywood, told <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>We’ll admit it was quite easy for all of us to forget that the glamorous actress mothered four children. (Did you know she even allegedly invented the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chocolate martini</a> with Rock Hudson? Click through to learn more.) However, her public image didn’t prevent her from being a supportive mom and friend to her kids in their times of need.</p><p>“She was more of the pal than the disciplinarian. She was the kind of mother who said, ‘I’m here if you want to talk to me.’” William also noted in his book, “She was only [20] when she had Michael, they weren’t that far apart in age, and she took that approach with all of them.”</p><p>Her close bond with her kids is obvious in these adorable photos below — and if it were up to us, we would have given her many “Mother of the Year” awards to go with all her Oscars.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Elizabeth Taylor’s Children in Photos</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfnK6tuMSrsGiekaK2rcWOnqOispGXsrW0jK2YsqSfp3qstcOsZGprYGuDdQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./moline-man-accused-of-arson-makes-court-appearance.html><span>←</span><span>Moline man accused of arson makes court appearance</span></a>
