Edit newsletter</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>What is a plunge pool?</h2><p id=eTj8vg_lZSvN data-wc=26>A plunge pool, also known as ice plunge pools, ice baths, are shallow tubs filled with ice cold water, or ice, to dip into hydrotherapy practice.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>What are the benefits of ice baths and plunge pools?</h2><p id=esJ-rSFFyblZ data-wc=13>There are numerous health benefits to cold water therapy, both physically and mentally.</p><p id=eOBiV2_iLQlf data-wc=51>Eva Katrín Sigurðarsóttir, Medical doctor and Certified Wim Hof Method instructor at <a aria-label=hvammsik class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Hvammsvík</a>, exclusively told us: "Cold water therapy has grown exponentially in popularity over the past few years with a committed, consistent practice including the breathing technique and cold exposure having proven to help you unlock a host of benefits.</p><p id=e3K-um1vUqvu data-wc=37>"As a result, an increase in energy, improved sleep quality, reduced stress levels, heightened focus and determination, increased willpower and even a stronger immune system have all been scientifically proven as benefits of the Wim Hof Method."</p><p id=eZ9DcoXCmJGa data-wc=20>Speaking on Dr. Rangan Chatterjee’s podcast, titled Feel Better, Live More, Dr Susanna Søberg&nbsp;explained the science behind cold therapy.&nbsp;</p><p id=esKrEzGa_EO5 data-wc=51>She said: "You stress your body in a very good way, but then you pause.&nbsp; Your calm is the rest of the day. This modern society we have turned this upside down.&nbsp; We are stressed all day, and do something else that will stress us.&nbsp; It eventually leads to chronic stress.</p><p id=e-Z_GW-REVyh data-wc=20>"Going into the cold is stressful, but it’s useful, because you do it at that time and then cold afterwards.</p><p id=e80G128AYUBW data-wc=87>"The healthy brown fat is quite opposite to our white fat, this special, mystic organ, is the temperature regulator we have in our body, and if we don’t get exposed to different temperatures changing on our skin, then we are not using this organ in our body. We have found out this organ is not only controlling our temperature from the inside, but also our metabolism. If people dont have healthy brown fat, they have obesity, a higher BMI, Type 2 diabetes, so there is a correlation.</p><p id=esjGaNUh-ZNd data-wc=37>"You have cold receptors on the skin, adrenalin kicks in, so this stressor will activate brown fat cells, which will take sugar and fat in as fuel, so you get warmer as you get into the cold."</p><h2 dir=ltr>How long do you need to stay in an ice bath for?</h2><p id=exlAgqCXzPOW data-wc=39>If you are looking to use an ice bath for the first time it is recommended you take it slow and steady.&nbsp; Just one minute can be sufficient to reduce stress, boost your immune system, and wake the body.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-iJHhzSevwA data-wc=16>However, some more seasoned ice water afficionados may last 10 to 15 minutes in cold water.</p><p id=euztjHv7MmxN data-wc=62>Eva advised: "For beginners that want to start out on their own, it is critical to avoid forcing the body to withstand the cold with gradual cold exposure training for example with cold showers being recommended prior.&nbsp;Forcing your body to stay immersed for too long in temperatures between 0-4 degrees can cause the body to go into a state of hypothermia.</p><p id=eUNyR7nuhr-2 data-wc=30>"A maximum of two&nbsp;minutes in an ice bath will give you anti-inflammatory effects and increased production of white blood cells (i.e boosts your immune system) that lasts six&nbsp;days."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Do ice baths help with weight loss?</h2><p id=eIzaS-7IKxEM data-wc=3>In short, yes.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecLZ1HRGCfNO data-wc=21>Cold water therapy produces "healthy" brown fat tissue, which calls on any glucose stored, kicks your adrenalin, and boosts your metabolism.&nbsp;</p><p id=efg2h6O0yVM8 data-wc=79><a aria-label=hvammsik class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Hvammsvík</a>&nbsp;expert, Eva, explained: "When the body comes into contact with the extreme cold, it will begin not only the production of brown fat tissue but the transformation of white fat tissue to brown. Packed densely with mitochondria, this brown fat tissue generates a significant amount of energy to heat the body and burns calories 560% faster than white fat tissue. The more brown fat tissue an individual has, the more one’s metabolism will increase, resulting in higher weight loss."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Do ice baths help with anxiety?</h2><p id=eCiUqK_0DpLG data-wc=1>Absolutely.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewf-AHCj7Jt9 data-wc=40>Cold water therapy has numerous mental health benefits, as it not only encourages the brave-hearted to focus on themselves and their breathing, which is paramount when anxiety hits, but also releases "happy hormones" to lift your mood, as Eva explains.</p><p id=eOpNjM751-lq data-wc=13>"Anxiety relief from ice water bathing is a significant benefit of the practice.</p><p id=eVQBQHonBm81 data-wc=54>"When an individual enters into the cold water, the body is shown to release what is commonly known as ‘happy hormones’, including serotonin, endorphins and oxytocin. Within just two minutes of time spent in a cold-water bath, our noradrenaline levels have been proven to increase by 530% along with our dopamine levels by 250%.</p><p id=ekVSWjKJE553 data-wc=16>"Production and spikes in these wellbeing and happy hormones has a significant effect on reducing anxiety.</p><p id=evPqffPWgfe9 data-wc=32>"Humans today are so used to comfort, never having to really experience intense spikes of our stress hormone levels, despite this having been proven to have a positive impact on our bodies.</p><p id=eumNjPcCBQh3 data-wc=60>"The act of cold-water bathing acts as a way to consciously initiate the body into a state of short-term stress. Physically, due to the spike in the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol,&nbsp; your blood will automatically divert blood to your extremities, your pupils will dilate, heartbeat will speed up, your senses will become heightened and blood pressure will become higher.</p><p id=eZOCx2LsPeve data-wc=30>"As a mechanism to preserve your core body temperature, protect vital organs and prevent hypothermia, the autonomic nervous system will make your capillaries constrict in reaction to the intense cold."</p><h3 dir=ltr>Polar</h3><p id=emyJrjP2SyVz data-wc=28>Polar has an impressive
