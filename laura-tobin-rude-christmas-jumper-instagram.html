But when <a class=hm-link href=#>Laura Tobin</a> got dressed on Tuesday morning, she was not expecting to get such a reaction over her pretty grey knit. Opting for double sparkles - because there's no better way to get in the festive spirit - she tucked the £49 <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>pale grey jumper from Sosander</a> into a slate&nbsp;grey sparkly <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>pleated skirt from New Look</a>. The <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Good Morning Britain</a></strong> star chose natural makeup and wore her dark hair in loose curls. However, her hair was at the centre of the drama!</span></p><p id=e_IzCP7CrV5><span style=background-color:initial></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/626db8d48c3b-laura-tobin-sparkle-jumper-z.jpg><p id=eN3avetz0K8 data-wc=78>The long curls covered the calligraphy on her jumper, so the word 'sparkle' printed in black was cut off mid-way, leading fans to misinterpret the letter 'r' for an 'n' instead. Ultimately, people believed the star was walking around proudly sporting a rude Christmas jumper that said 'spank.' Luckily, Laura saw the funny side and took to Instagram stories to set the record straight, showing her 53,900 followers before and after photos of her hair covering the jumper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7d64b853ff91-laura-outfit-z.jpg><p id=epQKlT54Sdcl data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>See the most lavish royal Christmas trees and decorations around the world</a></strong></p><p id=eEFa91wifS84 data-wc=91>Embarrassing misunderstanding aside, the grey cosy knit is widely popular, so much so that it is only available to buy online in size L. But we're hoping it will be restocked soon as the style has also been popular with <a class=hm-link href=#>Tess Daly</a> in the past. The <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a></strong> host rocked a very <a class=hm-link href=#>similar cream version</a> from high-street store River Island last year, which had the word 'sparkle' and a ruffle neck. Opting for a casual look, she paired it with a pair of black jeans and black boots as she sat on the famous sofa opposite Lorraine Kelly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/62518569a73b-tess-daly-sparkle-jumper-z.jpg><p id=eVure2NN8IOH data-wc=51>Tuesday wasn't the first time we have been obsessed with Laura's festive wardrobe.
