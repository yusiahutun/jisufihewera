In 2022, Rivian released Camp Mode, a neat software feature that takes full advantage of its highly capable vehicles various systems. The next time you go on an outdoor adventure, car camping, or tailgating on game day, you'll absolutely want to use it.</p><p>The R1T is already an excellent vehicle for camping or overlanding, thanks to the truck bed, gear tunnel, frunk storage, and second-row seat storage. With Camp Mode, everything is made better or more comfortable. While Rivian has released several options like Kneel Mode and Pet Comfort Mode, outdoor enthusiasts will get the most usage out of Camp Mode.</p><h2 id=what-is-rivian-camp-mode>What Is Rivian Camp Mode?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rivian-camp-mode-enable.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rivian's Camp Mode is similar to <a href=#>Tesla's Camp Mode</a>, which puts the vehicle in a low-power state but still gives you access to climate controls. However, it also does a lot more, and many of these are <a href=#>Rivian features that will make you want one</a>. Owners can optimize energy usage while the vehicle is parked, use all the charging ports, and even set timers to kill power to ports and outlets at a specific time.</p><p>Without the vehicle technically being on, you can play music on the radio, heat the cabin, or maintain airflow with the air conditioner on a warm summer night. While those climate options are great for R1 owners who may decide to sleep inside the vehicle, Camp Mode goes beyond climate options if you want to attach a tent or just sit by a campfire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, you can set Camp Mode to turn off all interior light sources, ensuring the vehicle is as dark as possible for a good night's rest, or light up your campsite with the floodlights that are built into the side mirrors. You can use the outlets in the back to blow up an air mattress, string up some lights for good vibes, and more.</p><h2 id=features-that-make-camp-mode-awesome>Features That Make Camp Mode Awesome</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of Camp Mode's best features is its ability keep to the interior comfortable enough for sleeping regardless of external temperatures. If you arrive at your destination after dark, Camp Mode can turn on the side mirror floodlights, giving you a hands-free flashlight. Now, you can easily set up a tent, organize your supplies, or dig through the gear tunnel.</p><p>Rivian vehicles also have standard height-adjustable air suspension, and Camp Mode uses it to help make sure your vehicle is level. This is very helpful for those sleeping in the truck's bed or if you have Rivian's optional <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">roof-top tent accessory</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you've ever gone camping and tried using a grill on the tailgate, only to realize you're not on flat ground and nothing stays put, you'll instantly understand how amazing this feature is. In that same sense, football fans tailgating before kickoff have experienced similar situations, and now you can tap a few buttons and the vehicle will level itself. It works front to back and side to side, with all four corners of the suspension working independently to ensure the truck is level.</p><p>Self-leveling takes anywhere from 20 seconds to over a minute, depending on external ground conditions. These are just a few features that make the <a href=#>Rivian R1T perfect for mountain adventures</a>.</p><h2 id=how-does-camp-mode-work>How Does Camp Mode Work?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rivian-camp.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Camp Mode is pretty simple to activate. To access it, tap the <strong>More</strong> icon near the bottom right corner of your infotainment display, then find the tent icon. Once you tap the tent, you'll see a wide selection of camping options to make your stop as comfortable as possible. Plus, you can control everything from the companion smartphone app, tap buttons on the infotainment display, and more.</p><p>Furthermore, Rivian has a neat "Camp courtesy" selection that will turn off all exterior lights, disable sounds like the keyless entry beep, and turn off proximity locking. That way, the vehicle won't auto-lock as you walk away. The courtesy option even ensures the climate controls run quieter.</p><p>Inside the main Camp Mode menu, owners can choose from <strong>Stay on</strong>, which will keep everything running, so you can enjoy music, lights, and vehicle features. Or, select <strong>Stay Off</strong> to kill all the lights inside, turn off outlets, disable Gear Guard, and make things dark and quiet when it's time for bed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Remember that Camp Mode won't engage if an incline is too steep and is only available when the vehicle is set to park.</p><h2 id=elevate-your-adventures-with-camp-mode>Elevate Your Adventures With Camp Mode</h2><p>So, the next time you're preparing for a camping trip or a tailgate party, remember that Camp Mode will make everything a little bit better. Get the vehicle level, turn on those exterior lights, heat up the grill, and don't forget to pull out that Bluetooth speaker that came with your vehicle.</p><p>There's nothing better than escaping reality and enjoying nature or the outdoors for a weekend. And you can comfortably do that with your Rivian R1T or R1S. It turns out these truly are "electric adventure vehicles" after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edGiraKZnmKwornPZqSonJVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-the-prophets-song-by-queen.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of The Prophets Song by Queen</span></a>
