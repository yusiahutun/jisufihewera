Essentially, a white noise machine can block out distractions and help you focus singularly on the hushing sound.</p><p>SNOOZ is a smart white noise machine that uses a real fan to create the perfect sound of whirring air. The best bit is that the sound is fully customizable, so you can choose the tone and set the volume.
