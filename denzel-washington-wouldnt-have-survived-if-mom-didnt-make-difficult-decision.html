But later the Unstoppable star gushed about how he would not have survived without his mother’s dreams and ambitions about him that ultimately pushed him to do more.</p><p>The actor gushed: “My parents got divorced when I was 14, so I was only around my father up until that time, but it was the religious instruction which supported me. Sure I went to church. We went every Sunday – sometimes during the week as well. It wasn’t fun; when you’re young you don’t want to go to church – you want to be running around in the streets with your friends.”</p><p>He added that his mother’s wish to send him to Oakland Military Academy in upstate New York helped him “get off the streets.” He revealed, “She got me off the streets, sending me to private school and in the summers sending me to camps. That decision changed my life. At school I developed an appreciation for reading. We had one teacher who used to have us read The New York Times, and it opened up a new world to me. I started caring about what was going on outside my own environment. He introduced me to literature: Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1485003229-1024x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-from-medicine-to-acting-washington-s-journey-was-a-long-one>From medicine to acting, Washington’s journey was a long one</h2><p>Denzel Washington immediately did not know that acting will be his career as he started studying medicine in college. “I was studying medicine at college, but found out quickly I didn’t want to be a doctor, as I wasn’t smart enough and I was just bored,” he said in an interview.</p><p>Only at 20, Denzel decided to take acting classes which would ultimately land him roles in productions of Eugene O’Neill’s The Emperor Jones and Shakespeare’s Othello putting him in the spotlight and garnering impressive reviews.</p><p>Denzel recalled: “People are telling me I’m good, so maybe it’s something I’m supposed to do. Maybe one day I’ll make $650 a week and work on Broadway.” It was never my plan to go to Hollywood.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-history-making-oscar>The history-making Oscar</h2><p>Denzel did not have to wait too long to make history in his acting career as he earned two Academy Awards within a decade of making it to Hollywood including his Best Actor Oscar snag for Training Day. Denzel became the second black performer (after Sidney Poitier) to win a Best Actor Oscar at that time writing a new page of history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-51093739-717x1024.jpg><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2h9cLDEp7GepF2srrS0yKeeraeeYsSwwcudpa1lmJbDpnnSrqmvoaaasW61xWakqKVdmbalutNmpJqjlWKxqrLFopqupKRisaavyKygqKZf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alejandra-robles-gil-and-alejandro-dominguez.html><span>←</span><span>Alejandra Robles Gil and Alejandro Domnguez</span></a>
