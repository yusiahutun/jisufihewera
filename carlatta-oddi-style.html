Oddi may have worked under Anna Dello Russo at Vogue Japan, but the style she has become synonymous with couldn’t be more different—while her magpie boss is well-known for her penchant for glitzy, straight-from-the-runway, head-to-toe looks, Oddi is a true bohemian at heart. When asked to describe her aesthetic, the Milanese-born Oddi says she doesn't like to stick to a precise dress code. “I guess chameleonic/eclectic," she explains. "I really like to mix and match different pieces, to combine a romantic dress with punk studded shoes, a Chanel bag with some tribal vintage jewelry. I love to discover small brands and love finding the perfect piece in a vintage store or flea market. In general, I really like crossover in life—of different worlds and inspirations.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That style served as the inspiration behind <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/alanui_/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Alanui class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Alanui</a>, a stylish sibling endeavor. Her brother Nicolò Oddi developed the knitwear brand, which centers around the cardigan, with Carlotta, who acts as muse and number one fan. It stands to reason then, that an Alanui cardigan—which translates to "large path" in Hawaiian—is the current most-loved piece in Carlotta’s enviable closet. “I just love it! It's one of the first cardigans we made when we started Alanui. The dark colors mixed with pale yellow basically go with any occasion. From a day look to evening attire… my brother Nicolò even used it as a tuxedo jacket for a gala. It really goes with everything...” See how Oddi wears her wardrobe MVP four ways.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Look 1: Evening Cocktail Look</strong></p><img alt="Clothing, Black, Fashion, Dress, Formal wear, Fashion design, Sleeve, Neck, Outerwear, Waist, " title="Clothing, Black, Fashion, Dress, Formal wear, Fashion design, Sleeve, Neck, Outerwear, Waist, " width=2101 height=2626 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-alanui-embed-04-1495055355.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Carlotta Oddi</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Alanui cardigan, Attico dress, Gucci shoes</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Why did you want to launch Alanui?

The entire project started from a trip Nicolò made to California, where he found this vintage cardigan that he ended up giving me for a trip I was planning to Hawaii. I wore it the entire time. I just could not take it off. The word ALANUI means “large path” in Hawaiian and we are aiming to create an item that is the perfect travel companion, a life-time piece that can follow you in all your experiences and journeys. It’s kind of a 'Linus blanket' that grows and connects with you, even emotionally."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Look 2: Easy and Basic Day Look<br></strong></p><img alt="Outerwear, Flooring, Floor, Sitting, Style, Picture frame, Wood flooring, Hardwood, Fashion, Street fashion, " title="Outerwear, Flooring, Floor, Sitting, Style, Picture frame, Wood flooring, Hardwood, Fashion, Street fashion, " width=2285 height=2857 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-alanui-embed-02-1495055426.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Carlotta Oddi</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Zoe Karssen t-shirt, Frame Denim jeans, Chanel shoes, Venus by Maria Tash earrings, Aliita ring, Jessie Western bracelets<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Why is knitwear an important category for you?</strong><br>"Knitwear is extremely versatile, you can play with it and style it in different ways, but it remains a comfortable, beautiful item."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Look 3:</strong> <strong>Perfect Day-to-Night Look</strong><strong></strong></p><img alt="White, Room, Interior design, Fashion, Black-and-white, Design, Furniture, Living room, House, Photography, " title="White, Room, Interior design, Fashion, Black-and-white, Design, Furniture, Living room, House, Photography, " width=2112 height=2640 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-alanui-embed-01-1-1495055505.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Carlotta Oddi</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Alanui cardigan, Saint Laurent dress, Saint Laurent belt, Frame denim jeans, Chanel shoes, Jessie Western necklaces</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Do you plan your outfits in advance?

I usually plan my outfits in advance and try to make combinations to use pieces more than once. I do prefer to travel light and not to bring things that I am not wearing.
