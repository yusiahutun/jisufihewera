It would look wrong in a real movie because it would just be CG [computer graphics].”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Erectile dysfunction – what causes it and six ways to keep it at bay</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eva is far from alone in her interest. According to statistics from Pornhub, the world’s largest pornography website, Hongkongers’ top site search in 2017 was “Japan” and the top category was “hentai”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Katrien Jacobs is an associate professor of cultural and religious studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who specialises in sexuality and pornography. She attributes the popularity of hentai in the city to the interest in exotic Japanese culture.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s not a surprise to me because the culture of manga and anime has been popular in Hong Kong since the 1960s … [the viewers] project their sexual desires on Japanese culture,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/30/944a4334-ab46-11e8-8796-d12ba807e6e9_972x_011201.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Jacobs, people are more drawn to ideas and concepts to which they are constantly exposed. “It is part of the culture of otaku [obsessive interest, especially in manga and anime]. Otaku consumers are even more used to extreme representation of sexist and misogynist porn.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jason Ho Ka-hang, an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Humanities who teaches courses on gender and sexuality, believes the attraction of hentai is the fantasy, and the escape it offers from a stifling, conservative culture.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The bigger the suppression, the larger the pushback. Hong Kong is relatively conservative and hentai is visually quite stimulating,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Eva, the escape is a large part of the appeal. “We all know it’s fantasy; it’s not real. Sometimes we need a place to imagine. All we need to do is to separate imagination from reality.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eva also thinks that women shouldn’t feel ashamed about watching porn, as it is an urge that probably stems from growing up believing they that should not talk about sex or sexual desire. That’s not what a “good girl” should discuss, she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Why should women feel ashamed to watch porn? Men can openly talk about porn and women, but why can’t women do the same? Women have their sexual desires and sexual interests, too. It’s natural to imagine and explore sex.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/30/c0db0f64-aa83-11e8-8796-d12ba807e6e9_1320x770_011201.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, there are concerns that for youngsters today, hooked on digital devices where pornography is just a click away, this may be where they go looking for information about sex. Inadequate sex education in Hong Kong schools may not be helping.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Hentai is an exaggerated porn of tortured, submissive women. It’s grotesque. Flesh cannot look like that in real life. It’s a kind of misrepresentationKatrien Jacobs</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A 2016 survey by the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong found that one-third of secondary school girls and 59 per cent of boys had watched pornography, up 5 percentage points from 2011. One-fifth of those boys had viewed porn more than 15 times in the month before the survey.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the age of consent in Hong Kong is 16, a person has to be 18 to legally watch pornography.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Sex education in our textbooks only showed cross-sections and profiles of penises, vaginas and wombs, and teachers tended to avoid talking too much about sexual intercourse,” Eva says. “We all grew up in a place where our sexual desires were suppressed. That’s why we are so curious about it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Japanese porn, particularly the hentai popular among Hongkongers, often depicts women as submissive or unwilling servants to male sexual appetites.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s an exaggerated porn of tortured, submissive women. It’s grotesque,” Jacobs says. “Flesh cannot look like that in real life. It’s a kind of misrepresentation.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Pole dancing and rope bondage: Hong Kong’s first consumer adult show</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ho says watching porn definitely affects heterosexual relationships. He believes men may imitate male characters in the videos, leading to macho sexual – and even sadistic – behaviour towards their partners.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vera Lui Wing-hang, founder of Hong Kong sex toy shop Sally Coco Intimate Lifestyle Store and a YouTube personality, agrees that women can be victims of pornography.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">On one hand students are more precocious, having their first sexual experience at a younger age, while on the other hand their sexual knowledge is getting worseJason Ho</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Traditional male-targeted porn objectifies women. Some of our customers, after watching AV [adult videos], think that their bodies have to look like the porn stars – like having no pubic hair or having a pink and symmetrical vagina,” she says. “But that’s not true. Everyone’s is a different colour.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Men are also misrepresented in pornographic movies, usually being depicted as sexual predators, and this stereotype can take a toll on relationships.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I have encountered many men who are not eager to have sex. Their girlfriends want to, but they don’t. They start to wonder whether they are abnormal because they have a low sexual desire,” Lui says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet, Jacobs explains, pornography exists to satisfy sexual fantasies, and is only really harmful when it becomes an addiction.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The only negative thing would be that [viewers] are not exposed to other kinds of erotica. I hope people will be a bit more diversified,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Hong Kong, which is notorious for its long working hours, the responsibility for sex education has shifted from parents to schools. However, statistics indicate that schools are not doing an adequate job.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Family Planning Association’s report revealed that about one-fifth of teenagers aged 14 to 16 who had had sexual intercourse believed they had insufficient knowledge about contraception, and more than half thought schools should provide more sex education.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/30/707fca98-aa90-11e8-8796-d12ba807e6e9_1320x770_011201.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The paradox is that on one hand students are more precocious, having their first sexual experience at a younger age, while on the other hand their sexual knowledge is getting worse,” Ho says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although most youngsters have sex for the first time at around the age of 19, almost one in 10 of those aged 18 to 27 having sex for the first time did not use any contraception, the association found.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">They can get all sorts of [sex] information online … they probably know much more than we doSex education coordinator at a Kwai Tsing school</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The current curriculum guideline on sex education in secondary schools dates back to 1997 and covers topics such as gender equality, reproduction, family life, interpersonal relationships, sexually transmitted diseases and marriage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The implementation of sex education depends on a school’s individual policies, though; the guideline serves only as a reference. Sex education has never been an independent subject, but integrated into Moral and Civic Education.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ng Man-lun, vice-president of the Hong Kong Sex Education Association, helped draft the 1997 guideline, but says it is now insufficient. “People these days face different [sexual] problems compared to 1997 … current sex education is not enough to prepare a person for his or her future sexual problems.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In one secondary school in Kwai Tsing district, students have on average only 4.5 hours of sex education in their entire six years of studies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The sex education coordinator, who asks that the school not be named, says it works with charities to organise workshops for students, focusing on promoting healthy values and how to maintain a relationship, instead of providing much factual sexual knowledge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Topics such as homosexuality, pornography and masturbation aren’t covered at all, leaving big gaps in students’ sexual knowledge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/08/30/22f58e5a-aa83-11e8-8796-d12ba807e6e9_1320x770_011201.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asked who the students can go to for advice if they have sexual problems or are confused, the coordinator says: “They can get all sorts of information online … they probably know much more than we do.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many teachers lack the teaching resources, support and time to effectively teach sex education, according to a 2015 survey by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ng says young people will watch porn regardless, but “parents and teachers should watch porn with teenagers together, and tell them what’s realistic and what’s not. Forbidding them to watch is not going to work”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">From porn to shopping, how the internet is fuelling new addictions</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eva says she didn’t learn much about sex in the classroom back in her schooldays.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I only learned the structure of our sexual organs. I learned more from the internet and porn, of course. But that’s dangerous because we were too young to understand the difference between fantasy and reality. We might have believed that women really liked to be treated rough … We might have missed the importance of safe sex,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s what Hong Kong society should do more – educate students instead of suppressing them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiuciloJ6rX5a%2FtbXCpZxoamFrfnmCj2iuobFdmbxuvMSop6WdXaG8t7GMoZynrJGeequtz5qlnquVYq6vtcyeZKmnoqN6qbvNoGSkp56c</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pageant-to-present-priyanka-chopra-drops-throwback-miss-world-pic-fans-say-she-forgot-to-age-1295179.html><span>←</span><span>Pageant to present: Priyanka Chopra drops throwback Miss World PIC; fans say she 'forgot to age'</span></a>
