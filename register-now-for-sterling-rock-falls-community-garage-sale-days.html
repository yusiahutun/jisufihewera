People take time off of work, traveling to our area, gather friends and family, and make plans to be a part of the event. This event generates a lot of activity in our community.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The garage sales are not only good for people buying and selling, but local businesses also reap great rewards,” says Bland. “Shoppers fill up their gas tanks and grab a bite to eat right here in our town. Several businesses have reported needing extra staff during the Garage Sale Days. Once the sales are over, sellers have a pocket full of cash. They are inclined to order a pizza after a hard day’s work. They also have extra cash to spend on home projects, school supplies, or new furniture.”&nbsp;</p><p>For regular updates, printable maps, registration forms and more, click <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKmen5mowaa%2BjKemsGWWpL9uv9OeqaWhnpx6s7vCpGSfmZyhwG6vzqakrqaZqcZus8CrmKCdXaiurbGMnZiyq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./isaac-rochell.html><span>←</span><span>Isaac Rochell</span></a>
