Her fiance shared video of the magic moment.</p><p>It all happened at the Forum in Los Angeles&nbsp;on July 28. Allie was backstage when boyfriend Jonathan Roberts dropped to a knee. Watch as the&nbsp;21-year-old bursts into tears, says yes and gives him a great big hug as her father is on stage singing "She's Every Woman." Roberts is a physical education teacher in Tennessee. Watch it go down:</p><p>That moment was separate from Brooks' onstage serenade. First Dad&nbsp;recognizes Allie&nbsp;a as a great songwriter, acoustic guitar player and singer — someone he's been singing with since 1996. Then he leads the crowd in singing "Happy Birthday" to his baby girl. She's surprised, and maybe a little embarrassed. But&nbsp;she's also preparing to sing on stage with her dad, so she's focused.</p><p>The "<a href=#>Ask Me How I Know</a>" singer&nbsp;has three daughters, including Taylor and August. He's also a two-time grandfather, with August giving him two granddaughters in recent years. Allie is the one most interested in singing. Earlier this year she posted an acoustic cover from her bedroom, <a href=#>singing her father's "She's Every Woman"</a>&nbsp;in a&nbsp;tender recreation of the hit.</p><p>Brooks' tour has offered surprises at seemingly every concert. Marriage proposals, baby gender reveals and <a href=#>free college tuition</a> are just a few of the jaw-dropping, non-song highlights from his world tour. He's <a href=#>set to wrap</a> the North American leg in 2017 and has hinted that he plans on traveling to Europe and beyond in the years to come.</p><p><strong>5 Garth Brooks Gifts That Changed Lives</strong></p><p><strong>Country's Highest Paid?
