<a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Neville</a>'s were questionable, and his trim didn't get much better throughout his <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Manchester United</a> playing days.</p><p>Since turning to punditry he's chopped it back and adopted a much more suave appearance, though.</p><h3>Cristiano Ronaldo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25947706.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS248570965.jpg> <img

in life: no one will top <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>'s glow-up.</p><p>When he arrived on English soil in 2003, the then 18-year-old had the teeth and dress sense of someone 60 years his senior and a terrible slicked back hairstyle.</p><p>Of course, after thousands upon thousands of hours in the gym and an improvement in his life choices, CR7 is now the envy of every male on planet Earth.</p><h3>Antonio Conte</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25947675.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_CS13277349.jpg> <img

data-content-type=section-topic>Tottenham</a> boss <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Antonio Conte</a> made the brave decision to get a hair transplant long before they were a well-discussed topic in the early 2000s.</p><p>He was clearly unhappy with the severe issues he'd been having, which were often focused on more than his performances.</p><p>The 52-year-old Italian has had the last laugh because he nows looks rejuvenated and youthful on the touchline.</p><h3>Sergio Ramos</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25947946.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GL771582.jpg>

him absolutely no favours whatsoever.</p><p>Fast forward a few years and he finally got the mop cut, which combined with a new thick beard made him look incredibly handsome while flying into challenges for <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Real Madrid</a> and Spain.</p><p>Ramos, who is also now shredded to the max, has since grown his hair out again, but he's learnt from his earlier mistakes and keeps it tied up in a smart look for <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>PSG</a> games.</p><h3>Luke Chadwick</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25947907.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JS253696959.jpg><p>Former United midfielder Luke Chadwick was relentlessly targeted for his appearance during his career and became the butt of a joke on TV panel show 'They Think It’s All Over'.</p><p>He opened up about <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>how it impacted his mental health</a> in 2020, and then received <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>apologies from presenting pair</a> Gary Lineker and Nick Hancock.</p><p>Chadwick looks like a completely different man now, with his infamous braces long gone and a shaved looked suiting him very well.</p><h3>Leon Goretzka</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25947703.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CS75898299.jpg>

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25947704.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CS75898282.jpg><p>While Ronaldo's may be the most impressive, Leon Goretzka's glow-up was by far and away the quickest - he went from skin and bones to Popeye seemingly overnight!</p><p>Before the 2020 lockdown the <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Bayern Munich</a> and Germany midfielder looked as though a slight gust of wind could blow him over.</p><p>He made the most of the time off and hit the gym like a mad man, so by the time the season resumed he had become football's muscle man. Incredible stuff.</p><h3>Lionel Messi</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25947914.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS123308279.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24587911.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Leon-Goretzka.jpg><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Lionel Messi</a> has epitomised the phrase 'ageing like fine wine' both on and off the pitch.</p><p>With every of the seven Ballon d'Or's he has collected, the legend of the game looked better and better, though it could only go up from his initial out of control hairstyle.</p><p>Much like Ramos, cutting it short and growing a beard brought about a massive upgrade and he is now very attractive as a player and as a man.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25943831><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Man Utd flops want Cristiano Ronaldo to 'lighten up' as star 'intimidates' team-mates" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25943831><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25947916.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CD23615845.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25944086.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_JS255046920.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25943831>Man Utd flops want Cristiano Ronaldo to 'lighten up' as star 'intimidates' team-mates</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25934702><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="Nine massive players Chelsea nearly signed during Roman Abramovich's early years" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25934702><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25947919.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS254626871.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25938855.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_Untitled-1.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25934702>Nine massive players Chelsea nearly signed during Roman Abramovich's early years</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cLHIoJ%2BtZaWhwaq5wK2cZp%2BcpMRuwc%2BsZKunnpa5pbuMa2xybGdqfXk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./black-iconic-style-gods-is-set-to-premiere-on-bet-network.html><span>←</span><span>Black &amp;amp; Iconic: Style Gods Is Set To Premiere On BET Network</span></a>
