Such is the pitch for The Sex Lives of College Girls, an HBO Max show that recently finished its first season and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a38451883/sex-lives-of-college-girls-season-2-date-cast-rumors-news/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="has been picked up for a second" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>has been picked up for a second</u></a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Created by Mindy Kaling, the show follows Bela (Amrit Kaur), a vibrantly sex-positive student of South Asian descent, determined to pursue a career in comedy; Leighton (Reneé Rapp), a wealthy white student from a conservative family who uses a frosty exterior to conceal her sexual orientation; Kimberly (Pauline Chalamet), a sheltered, working-class white student from small-town Arizona whose understanding of the world is daily modified; and Whitney (Alyah Chanelle Scott), a Black student and star athlete who feels disconnected from almost everyone, including her senator mother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Amrit Kaur, who plays Bela, is likely the show’s breakout star. Yes, she’s open about her sex positivity, but that’s not the only aspect of her personality that makes her revolutionary. She is both confident and insecure, fearless and anxious, committed yet flexible. Below, BAZAAR.com spoke with Kaur prior to the Season 1 finale about defying South Asian stereotypes and expectations, and the intersection between Bela and herself.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Bela’s sex positivity is a revolutionary thing on Western television. Is this the first time your parents have heard the word sex coming out of your mouth?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I don’t know if it’s the first time they’ve heard sex coming out of my mouth, being the obnoxious child that I am. You have to be slightly obnoxious to play a character like Bela [she pronounces it as it is on the show, “Bella”], or Bela [pronouncing it the Indian way, “Bay-lah”], as my parents would call her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What has been revolutionary about this is that my conservative family—and I think this is an anomaly—has been able to have conversations about sex. About the realities of sex. And this is in a family where my father comes from a place where opposite genders aren’t even supposed to look at each other, let alone a father talking to his daughters about this. We began to have conversations about the lies that are told between child and parent, in North America, and he spoke about a lot of his friends, who pretend that their daughters are extremely innocent; meanwhile, we’re going to school, changing our clothes. We have boyfriends. I hope that Bela has inspired conversations, just like in my family, between parents and children who are South Asian, but not even South Asian, just any community.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The most important thing about Bela is that Bela is not a South Asian character having sex onscreen. She’s a human having sex onscreen. And this role will hopefully start getting South Asians out of being the “first South Asian to have sex onscreen,” “the first bisexual South Asian to have sex onscreen.” Just a human that’s having sex onscreen, and is intelligent, and has a comedy career. That eventually, South Asians can be looked at just as humans.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>It is “Bay-lah,” not “Bella.” Does it bother you that Bela doesn’t pronounce it the way her parents pronounce it?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think that’s reality. Bela is a character who, like many Indo-Canadian or Indo-American girls, so wants to fit into white culture, and hasn’t seen many people who look like her on Western television, and has so much self-loathing to even think of herself as Indian. I did that. For a long time I was “Aym-ritt,” which is disgusting. It doesn’t sound good.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’m happy the writers chose to reveal that insecurity through Bela. She’s not there yet, where she can say “Bay-lah.” It was only three years ago I started telling my friends and family that my name is “Um-rith.” You pronounce it like a U, not an A. All my life, I’d been called “Aym-ritt.” It didn’t make me angry. It made me feel like we’re finally revealing truths about being a South Asian born in America and Canada, where people are still learning to pronounce our names. We’re outsiders. [Bela] is excited to compare herself to the white ingénue, because she doesn’t feel like the white ingénue. Maybe we’ll see that in three or four years, where she’ll be like, “Bay-lah.”</p><p>Because I’m a newcomer, I don’t have a lot of clout. But at the same time, that’s my small little form of self-love or activism. But at least we’re starting to normalize being South Asian. If you can pronounce “Saoirse,” as in Saoirse Ronan, if you can make the effort to learn a Caucasian name, then you can make the effort to learn a South Asian name as well.<br></p><img alt="amrit kaur" title="amrit kaur" width=1800 height=2700 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rr-harpers-kaur-dsc04008-v1rgb-1639765229.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Randall Ross</span></p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How did you react when you first read the script for Episode 6, during which Bela is sexually harassed?</strong><br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was happy that we’re talking about the realities of being a young woman exploring sex. Bela has to deal with the reality of being an intelligent woman who’s a minority, open about her sexuality, and the implications of that. And I think it’s beautiful to explore the gray line. It’s very gray throughout. It’s a good conversation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The writers and directors made a choice that Bela, at least in Season 1, is struggling with her vulnerability. She always resorted to humor. So I would cry between takes. I would be emotional between takes. Because it is emotional. And the analysis was personal. Bela feels like she’s so desperate to be on The Catullan [the prestigious college comedy club], this high-level thing, that she’s willing to stay quiet and pretend nothing happened in negotiation of getting a spot on her dream job. That’s scary. And she’s so young. She feels that this is the only way she can reach her dreams. So she also feels scared to speak up, because she thinks this is her only shot.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Your chemistry with Pauline Chalamet was particularly bright. You guys have a great rapport, maybe because she’s the straight one and you’re the wacky, zany goofball. She has her own adventures, but when you guys are together, it’s very much a yin-and-yang pairing. Is that something you noticed while you were working?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes. Coming from an actor’s perspective, my approach was that I think Bela thinks that Kimberly is her apprentice [laughs]. Bela herself feels like such an outsider. When she’s with Leighton and Whitney, who are the two cool hot girls, arguably, conventionally, she’s still grappling to be cool. But when she’s with Kimberly, she’s like, “I got one on her.” Because she’s less awkward than Kimberly—even though she is awkward, that’s why she relates to Kimberly—and because she’s had sex one more time than Kimberly, she thinks she has one more on her. I think that friendship is actually based on insecurity, that she doesn’t fit in with the cool girls (Leighton and Whitney), and she feels one one-night stand ahead of Kimberly. So she can find some sense of not feeling like a loser when she’s with Kimberly.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>There’s a kind of earnestness with the cool girls. I love the idea of her being your intern. Like, “I will show you the way.”</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes, “I’ve only had sex one more time than you, but I will show you.”</p><img alt="amrit kaur" title="amrit kaur" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pauline-chalamet-renee-rapp-alyah-chanelle-scott-amrit-kaur-1639765197.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span></p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>There’s another great moment where she has sex with someone she concludes is a “chuckle fucker.” Do you think that’s a clue to her insecurity? Because she wants to hear during sex, “Hey, you, too, are fucking hot.” She wants the compliment back. Does that mean she doesn’t want to have sex with those who only find her funny?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think she deeply, deeply wants to be fucked by someone who thinks she’s [uses air quotes] a 10, whatever that means. She’s not conscious about all of these things. I felt all these things. I wasn’t conscious about them when I was 19, 20. But she’s so self-loathing that she wants to be validated by male attention. The fuckability factor is very important to her; what number she is on the scale is very important to her. She will do whatever it takes to get as high as possible on that scale. That’s why she’s dating these guys who are arguably out of her league, and it deflates her self-esteem when someone tells her she’s just attractive only because she’s funny. Another reason why she does comedy is to make herself more attractive, which a lot of comedians do.</p><img alt="amrit kaur" title="amrit kaur" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/amrit-kaur-1-1639765624.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span></p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Bela ultimately leaves The Catullan. I was heartened to see that as strong as her ambition is, as dedicated as she is, she will not compromise it at the expense of her ethics, at the expense of her self-esteem. She is sitting in a room where she has longed to be for many years, and yet the people in this room are making her feel like an object and a liar. She quit the thing that she went to that college for.</strong><br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think Bela has to decide what she really wants and what she’s willing to sacrifice for it. She wants to be on SNL, but is she willing to choose the path where she would exploit herself, where people would underestimate her intelligence, where people would objectify her? Or is she going to take the harder path where she might have to create material on her own, start something new; where her intelligence, her mind, her humor are appreciated? Bela is [realizing] that things are not going to be as easy as she had hoped. She is not a beautiful, white, skinny girl. Her experience is going to be different. And she has to decide whether she loves comedy enough to take the bullets that will come her way to reach her dreams.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think something in her mind just clicked. I think, in the final scene, what’s happening is that she’s coming to consciousness of what she really wants. And it’s not sad, per se, it’s not even happy. It’s just, “Is this what I really wanted?” I think we all have those moments. That’s what she’s discovering.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGiemaG6bsDVaJhscGVohneCkmiYpqqZqXqsrdSrZKydqGK5qsLErGSonl2YvK24xKCcZp%2BZp7m0ecinq56qpp6yuHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./martha-mae-salitan-husband-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Net Worth of Erik Salitans wife Martha Mae Salitan 2022; Personal Life</span></a>
