In his quest to find answers, Harry sought help and tried all methods but some came with severe side effects that he was not prepared for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1150303662-765x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-recalls-embarrassing-incident-at-friend-s-wedding>Prince Harry recalls embarrassing incident at friend’s wedding</h2><p>In the memoir <a href=#>Spare</a>, the Duke of Sussex gets brutally honest about the situations he went through while finding an answer for his anxiety and panic attacks. The 39-year-old <a href=#>royal</a> revealed he confided in his father King Charles about the “psychological, emotional minefield” that he was navigating, where the next explosion of panic could come at any second.</p><p>Harry shared that, initially, he did go to a doctor but that was a general practitioner who could only give him pills. Harry wanted to exhaust every other method first and discovered magnesium as a trick that could work. Harry recounted that magnesium did calm him down but he wasn’t aware of the unpleasant side effects which he found out on the wrong day.</p><p>Harry writes: “But in large quantities, it also had unpleasant side effects – loosens the bowels – which I learned the hard way at a mate’s wedding.”</p><p>Harry does not detail the incident but it is safe to assume that it was embarrassing to have a loose bowel at a wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1750491417-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-suppose-it-s-my-fault>“I suppose it’s my fault”</h2><p>Harry claims that his father was aware of his battles. “Pa, I’m really struggling with panic attacks and anxiety,” Harry told his father at one point.</p><p>He also brought back memories of one dinner scene at Highgrove where he spoke at length with ‘Pa.’</p><p>“I gave him the particulars, told him story after story. Towards the end of the meal, he looked down at his plate and said softly: I suppose it’s my fault. I should’ve got you the help you needed years ago. I assured him that it wasn’t his fault,” Harry shared. “But I appreciated the apology.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2d9cLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2Gaqrp6Wmr%2BmsIyerZ6qqaS7pr%2BMsKarq6Riu6qzx62kmqqVYq61ecBmnauhlaOxtHnWnpudoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./idnr-releases-il-waterfowl-hunting-updates.html><span>←</span><span>IDNR releases IL waterfowl hunting updates</span></a>
