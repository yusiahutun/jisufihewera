The Netherlands’ biggest city is almost synonymous with the sex shops, brothels and prostitutes huddled in the narrow streets close to the main railway station, drawing perhaps even more tourists than they do clientele.
Some of the city’s quaint narrow houses serve as brothels with their characteristic bay windows on the ground floor, where the sex workers sit under red lights awaiting the next customer."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It’s been a long time since HIV was taboo here.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m not scared at all. Some of my friends are HIV-positive and still carry on working. It’s possible nowadays,” says the 25-year-old American, referring to the progress medicine has made in treating those infected with the virus.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prostitution was legalised in the Netherlands in 2000 and sex workers can register with the local chamber of commerce and pay income tax.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Around 7,000 people work in the paid-sex sector in Amsterdam, with around 75 per cent of them coming from low-income countries, particularly eastern Europe, according to official figures.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Describing herself as “married and polyandrous,” Elsa says she has been a sex worker since the age of 17.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The window where she sits looks out onto one of Amsterdam’s many canals and is opposite the brothel where she first worked when she arrived in the Netherlands, having fled the many restrictions on her trade in the United States.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like Foxxy Angel, Elsa goes for HIV tests several times a year at a centre financed by the city near their workplace.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m very careful, I use condoms.
