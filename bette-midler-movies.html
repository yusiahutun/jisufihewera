And Bette Midler movies have long been some of our laugh-out-loud or cry-out-loud favorites.</p><p>We’re thrilled that Midler will soon be starring in Prime Video’s Sitting in Bars With Cake, which premiers on September 8, 2023. Inspired by true events, it brings the beloved blog and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">book by Audrey Shulman</a>&nbsp;to life as it follows a quiet young woman Jane (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yara Shahidi</a>) who is unlucky in love. One day she takes a cake she baked for her best friend’s birthday into a bar and finds herself swarmed by men. She’s convinced it’s a fluke, but her friend Corinne (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Odessa A’zion</a>) talks her into spending a year baking and then taking the cakes into bars — also known as “cakebarring” — in the hope that it will help her find true love and develop confidence. Midler plays the sassy Benita, Corrine’s boss.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Are you excited for Sitting in Bars With Cake? The anticipation for Midler’s newest heartfelt movie inspired us to take a walk down memory lane. Keep reading to learn more about Bette Midler’s life and see some of our favorite Bette Midler movies.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bette Midler young</h2><p>Before she made her way to the stage and screen, Bette Midler grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii, where she and her family lived a modest life.&nbsp;Named after the actress Bette Davis, Midler attended Radford High School in Honolulu, where she was voted “Most Talkative” and “Most Dramatic” in her senior year, graduating with the class of 1963.&nbsp;</p><p>Majoring in drama at the University of Hawaii, Midler left after three semesters.&nbsp;With an uncredited role as a seasick passenger in the 1966 film Hawaii, Bette made enough money to relocate to New York City to study theater under the famed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Uta Hagen</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>Her legacy began in several off-Broadway plays, prior to her Broadway work in Fiddler on the Roof and Salvation in the late 1960s.&nbsp;Then in the summer of 1970, Midler began singing at the Continental Baths and became close to her piano accompanist, Barry Manilow, who went on to produce her first album in 1972, The Divine Miss M.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-452486232.jpg><p>Since then, she’s released an additional 13 studio albums.&nbsp; When asked if there were any songs that she regrets, the Emmy-winner recognized that in everyone’s career, there are going to be “some stinkers.”&nbsp; In her eyes, one of those was her song “Married Men,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade.</a></p><p>On the other hand, she reflected on one of her biggest hits, “Wind Beneath My Wings,” calling the song “human.” Originally a country song, Midler was hesitant about singing it because she thought it too sentimental, until one of her friends told her, “If you don’t sing this song, I’ll never speak to you again.”&nbsp;She told Parade, “As the years have gone by, I revised my opinion because I could see how moving it was.”&nbsp;</p><p>Midler’s first starring film role came with the musical drama The Rose in 1979, which won her the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. And since, she’s been brining down the house with film after film.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Bette Midler’s husband?</h2><p>Midler is sentimental when it comes to her decades long marriage to Martin von Haselberg, whom she married in a Vegas Elvis chapel in 1984.&nbsp;The two have one daughter, Sophie von Haselberg, who is following in her mom’s acting and producing footsteps.&nbsp;</p><p>Bette revealed on Jimmy Kimmel Live that up until a few years ago, she had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">no photos of her and her husband’s special day</a>.&nbsp; “There were no cellphones in 1984, so we had no pictures.”&nbsp; She was ecstatic when a few years ago, out of the blue, an employee who had worked at the chapel sent her photos from her big moment.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Bette.jpg><p>The “Wind Beneath My Wings” singer told Good Morning Britain, “He really is the wind beneath my wings; he has looked after me for many, many years; he’s sacrificed a lot.&nbsp;I am proud of my marriage and our relationship because it is the oldest marriage in Hollywood.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bette Midler Movies</h2><p>Let’s take a look at Midler’s catalog over the decades:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Rose (1979)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/bette.jpg><p>Midler’s first starring film role was as a drug-addicted rock star modeled after the late Janis Joplin in the 1960s-era rock-and-roll tragedy The Rose.&nbsp;The film earned her an Oscar nomination and she won the Golden Globe for Best Actress.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Divine Madness (1980)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/skjfnskjrfn.jpg><p>In 1980, Bette Midler’s concert film Divine Madness showcased her comedy routines and musical performances.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jinxed!
