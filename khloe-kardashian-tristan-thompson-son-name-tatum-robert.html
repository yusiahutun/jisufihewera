But, I haven't announced it yet.”</p><p>Explaining why it took her a while to choose the boy’s name, she said: "He was delivered via <a href=#>surrogate</a>, or the stork I like to say, and at first, I did not know what I was going to name him.</p><p>"I wanted to meet him and feel him out a little bit, and so at first he didn't have a name.”</p><p>She also explained that she was waiting until the premiere of the upcoming season of The <a href=#>Kardashians</a> for the boy’s name to be revealed.</p><p>Season three of the hit show is due to be released on <a href=#>Hulu</a> on May 25.&nbsp;</p><p>Khloe said: "He's been named, but I've been waiting for the premiere of our show.&nbsp;</p><p>“So now I'm just like, if my daughter outs me, I'm screwed.”</p><p>Khloe also referred to the boy, who is now nine months old, as a “little chunk”, saying she “wouldn’t have it any other way.”</p><p>She added: “I love a chubby baby. He is a quiet baby.&nbsp;</p><p>"He's a happy baby, which is amazing. My daughter was the same, so I've been lucky twice.”</p><p>Khloe had already said during the premiere of season two of The Kardashians that her son’s name would start with a T.&nbsp;</p><p>"I mean, that's really the only names I've been looking at,” she said.</p><p>"We can name him Travis and then just have an easy three," her mom Kris Jenner then joked, in reference to Kylie Jenner’s baby daddy <a href=#>Travis Scott</a> and <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a>’s husband <a href=#>Travis Barker</a>.</p><p>Tatum is a given name of <a href=#>English</a> origin which is used for both boys and girls.&nbsp;</p><p>The name can also be spelled Taytum, which is usually seen as a girl’s moniker.</p><p>It was originally derived from a place name meaning “Tata’s homestead” in Old English.&nbsp;</p><p>Child actress <a href=#>Tatum O’Neal</a> is among the best-known figures who have been given the name.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>It also had a boost in popularity after 1996 when it was borne by a character played by <a href=#>Rose McGowan</a> in the hit movie <a href=#>Scream</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. Sun has reached out to Khloe's rep for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/khloe-kardashian-reveals-first-look-814662343.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/kris-jenner-reveals-khloe-kardashians-777886905.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYGiBdoOUaKKhpJ%2Baeqyt0Z2YrKCZlrtuwNGiqq2ZnmLBqbvMqaqopl2ovK95zZqknmWklsG2uYyrppudoql8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joe-buddens-net-worth-updated-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Joe Budden's Net Worth (Updated 2023)</span></a>
