Canfield allegedly told Vidal. "Like going to bed with Jack in the room next to mine in the south of France and then … boasting about it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the biography notes, it’s unclear whether Vidal is telling the truth. He bore a complex relationship with both sisters through the years and was known for a proclivity to gossip. However, this would make any resentment Jackie would harbor toward Lee — even in her dying days — logical.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGealrCstcRmop6mnpqxunnSoqqtnaJiuaaxjKuYnbKZrLatuIyjnaRlkZuzorXRZpmop5s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./princess-dianas-footsteps-walk-through-london-past.html><span>←</span><span>In Princess Dianas footsteps: a walk through London, past Buckingham Palace to Kensington Palace</span></a>
