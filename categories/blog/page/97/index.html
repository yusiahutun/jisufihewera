Are you excited for the upcoming Blu-ray release of Back to the Future? Eric Stoltz probably isn’t! Having used up all other salable bonus features on BTTF’s 2002 DVD set, Universal will finally liberate footage of Stoltz as Marty McFly — shot over five weeks in 1984, before he was fired and replaced by Michael J. Fox — when the upgraded trilogy arrives in stores on October 26. At some point over the past 25 years, Stoltz had presumably made peace with losing his greatest-ever job in one of history’s biggest movie franchises — while secretly rooting for the death of physical media so as to avoid this footage’s eventual release.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sushi in New York that wont break the bank?
