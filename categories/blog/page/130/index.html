Ayy, ayy, look

Yeah, I’m anti ’cause I had it with you
Okay, I’m auntie like your daddy sister</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Florida woman who was attacked by a bear says her neighbor regularly fed them</h2><time>Mar 5, 2024</time>

Whether it's deciding what salon to go to or if you want a bob or a new set of bangs, there's a lot to consider when getting a haircut. One logistic you may not realize is worth ironing out? If you're going to get a dry haircut or not. Dry haircuts are nothing new. In fact, this type of cutting has been the go-to method for stylists for years, especially for clients with textured hair.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Misty Copeland Channels Edgar Degas</h2><time>Mar 4, 2024</time>

Ballet dancers, Misty Copeland tells me, like to be in control. It's something about ballet itself—the painstaking quest to achieve the appearance of a kind of effortless athleticism, fluidity, and grace—that makes it hard to let go. "I think all dancers are control freaks a bit," she explains. "We just want to be in control of ourselves and our bodies. That's just what the ballet structure, I think, kind of puts inside of you.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>My Go-To $13 Hair Spray Is a Celebrity Stylist Staple Used on Megan Fox</h2><time>Mar 4, 2024</time>

With the exception of Pond’s Cold Cream, few beauty products have transcended time like L'Oréal’s Elnett Satin Extra Strong Hold Hairspray. Reportedly released back in the ‘60s, it’s since become a widespread staple for celebrity hairstylists, my 72-year-old mom (who's been team Elnett since its inception), and yours truly. &nbsp; Celebrity stylist Dimitris Giannetos, who has worked with the likes of Gigi Hadid and Amal Clooney, relied on Elnett’s strong hold spray to add natural-looking hold and shine to Megan Fox’s new racy red bob.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Noodling on WordPress in 2023 Chris Coyier</h2><time>Mar 4, 2024</time>

I was catching up on Matt’s latest State of Word the other day. I’m something of a career-long user and fan. WordPress has changed a heck of a lot over the past few years. One big change was the Block Editor (aka Gutenberg). I wasn’t maybe on the bleeding edge, but I was a pretty early adopter. I think it’s an awfully good idea and a big upgrade to the page creation and writing experience.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rey Mysterio's bio: wife, kids, net worth, and wrestling career</h2><time>Mar 4, 2024</time>

Wrestling is one of those things that divides the world into two factions for many reasons. Most notably, half the world views wrestlers like Rey Mysterio as entertainers worthy of being idolized, while to the other half, wrestling wastes time and resources. In addition, many people opposed to wrestling argue that the sport promotes violence. However, the biggest disappointment is for those who learn that wrestling is scripted and the events inside the ring are staged.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Is He Dating Now After Bruna Biancardi?</h2><time>Mar 4, 2024</time>

As one of the most famous football players in the world, it’s understandable why fans want to know more about Neymar’s girlfriend and who he’s dating now.
