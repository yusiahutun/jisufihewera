She stripped naked on The Bachelor to skinny dip with Ben Flajnik.
And reportedly, that was not the first time Courtney Robertson has bared all in front of the cameras as she allegedly once posed nude for a photo shoot.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>CMA Fest to Celebrate '50 Years of Fan Fair' With New Documentary</h2><time>Sep 7, 2024</time>

The CNN anchor and his ex split in 2018, but live together and are raising sons Wyatt and Sebastian There aren't many people who would opt to live with their ex-boyfriend, but for Anderson Cooper and Benjamin Maisani, that's what works best for them and their kids.
The former couple were together for almost ten years before they split in early 2018. But in 2020, the two – still very close platonic friends but no longer romantically attached – decided to become fathers together for the first time.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Two Things That are Not Great About OKLCH Chris Coyier</h2><time>Sep 7, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../two-things-that-are-not-great-about-oklch.html></a>
I’m still a fan of the OKLCH color model and CSS function. But there are a couple of things that are confusing or weak about it, and it’s probably fair to point those out clearly. 1) Adjusting the L, C, and H values by hand is a bit dangerous Dangerous because of totally invalid combinations. Here’s an example.
I’ve got this perfectly normal green color:
.el { border-color: oklch(68% 0.25 150); }Code language: CSS (css) Well, I know that 68% is the Lightness, 0.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>White Mountain Bari Clogs Are Nearly 50% Off at Amazon</h2><time>Sep 7, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../white-mountain-bari-clog-sale-amazon-7375804.html></a>
I’ll say it: I love clogs. And while my go-to spring shoe choice may be controversial, I can proudly pledge my allegiance to the trend thanks to the it-girls who came before me; Kendall Jenner, Kaia Gerber, and Riley Keough have all been spotted wearing clogs on repeat. Love them or hate them, there’s no denying the polarizing shoes are everywhere this season, and they’re not leaving anytime soon. If you’re looking to give the comfortable slip-ons a try, you’re in luck — my favorite pair of clogs, which is nearly identical to the style worn by celebs, is just $41 at Amazon.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to Disable and Remove the Google Chrome Reading List</h2><time>Sep 6, 2024</time>
