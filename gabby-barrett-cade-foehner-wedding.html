The intimate wedding took place in Texas, where the groom is from.</p><p>"I spent a lot of time [in Texas] this summer with his family — it’s a great place to get off the grid and relax,” Barrett told <a href=#>People</a>, who broke the story. "The venue is in a neat little private area down some dirt roads, which totally fits our style."</p><p>The wedding atmosphere had a woodsy,&nbsp;rustic feel, using shades of plum and blush. "Texas is such a perfect backdrop for the start of our marriage," Barrett continued. "The setting of our wedding in the woods really influenced the decor and feel of our big day."</p><p>Their guest list was filled with familiar faces: The presider was&nbsp;friend Jeremy Vuolo, who is the husband of Jinger Duggar of the reality television show, Counting On. Also in attendance were Idol&nbsp;alums Caleb Lee Hutchinson, who&nbsp;served as a groomsman, and Catie Turner.</p><p>For the couple's first dance, they chose an instrumental tune from 1959, "Sleep Walk"&nbsp;by Santo and Johnny Farina. "It’s such a beautiful melody," Barrett gushed. "It feels really cinematic and special, and I think it’s going to make the moment memorable for us."</p><p>The "laid-back evening" showcased some of their favorite foods. "Cade loves Mexican food and I love American, so we will have both food options," Barrett explained. "And, of course, lots of cake!"</p><p>The couple met during their respective runs on Idol in 2018. They announced their <a href=#>engagement</a> in March of 2019. Foehner proposed to Barrett by surprise during a trip to Los Angeles, where they ended up staying at the same hotel they stayed in during their run on Idol. The proposal actually took place in the same room where they met for the first time.</p><p><strong>Check Out One-Time American Idol Star Jimmie Allen's New Song</strong></p><p><strong>Country Singers Married or Engaged in 2019</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJmSl8ZursCrqZ6spGKworDEZp2onZijsrN51p6bnaGenHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brothers-osborne-randy-owen-st-jude-childrens-research-hospital.html><span>←</span><span>Country Stars Share The Moment They Knew St. Jude Was Special</span></a>
