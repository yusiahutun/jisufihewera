An uncle seldom scorns you no matter how bad you mess up. On the contrary, they lend their ears when you need them to listen to you and always give you the best advice. That's why it is a big blow for anyone to lose an uncle because that person would have lost not only an uncle but also a friend, role model, and advisor. In such a situation, the best thing you can do is to write the best tribute to a late uncle and celebrate the special moments you had together.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c140349c5f4e9e39.jpg><h2 class=table-of-contents__title>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h2><p class=align-left>Writing a farewell message to an uncle who passed away is not an easy thing to do. You may have a lot to say but lack the words to express your feelings. However, since you want him to have the best send-off, you have no choice but to craft a beautiful passage worthy of the legacy he built. It does not matter whether it is one sentence, paragraph, or even a poem, but it must be from the heart.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/009f21e0b05e4bb3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 touching letter to your boyfriend expressing your hurt feelings</span></p></a><h2 id=470823-tribute-to-a-late-uncle class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Tribute to a late uncle</h2><p class=align-left>No words can be enough to describe a beloved uncle who passed away.

My heartfelt condolences go to the entire family.</li><li>Uncle, you are gone, but you will never be forgotten. We may be apart, but your memory will live within me forever.</li><li>I am only left with your memories to live with now. No words can express my grief. I pray that God will bring peace and solace to your family. Rest in peace, uncle.</li><li>He passed away because his body had served its purpose.
