The singer who's known for his biting sense of humor on Twitter is one of the more gifted vocalists in country music. Of course, this is no shocking revelation to his longtime fans. The Entertainer of the Year award is justified for a singer who often reaches to the edge of his emotions.</p><p>Which lyrics are his best lyrics? It's easy to favor his ballads, but that's overlooking the clever rhymes and sayings in songs like 'Hillbilly Bone' and 'Boys 'Round Here.' Only one of those songs make this Best Blake Shelton Lyrics list. The others are built around love, lost love and silly romance.</p><ul><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Warner Nashville</span></p>Warner Nashville<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>5</span><h2>'God Gave Me You'</h2>"Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs / God gave me you for the days of doubt / And for when I think I've lost my way / There are no words here left to say, it's true / God gave me you"<p>Perhaps this song wouldn't be as special if Shelton wasn't thinking of now-wife <a href=#>Miranda Lambert</a> when he cut it. It was a hit on Christian radio before the country singer put his mark on it. The lyrics aren't quite as vibrant as some others on this list, but the message is one every country fan can relate to.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>4</span><h2>'Hillbilly Bone'</h2>"We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside / No matter where you're from you just can't hide / When the band starts bangin' and the fiddle saws / You can't help but hollerin', 'Yee haw!'"<p>Luke Laird and Craig Wiseman came together to pen this rowdy track from the 'Hillbilly Bone' EP. In Shelton and <a href=#>Trace Adkins</a>, they found the perfect duo to turn their vision into a standout performance. Every word of this wonderful song serves the overall purpose of proving there is a little redneck in all of us.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Warner Music Nashville</span></p>Warner Music Nashville<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>3</span><h2>'Who Are You When I'm Not Looking'</h2>"My oh my, you're so good looking / Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends / But I've not tasted all your cooking / Who are you when I'm not looking"<p>Earl Bud Lee and John Wayne Wiggins wrote this easy-to-repeat love song. Like 'Honey Bee,' a hit that would come a few years later, the song's beauty is in its simplicity. The two mens' efficiency and reliance on highlighting the little details that make someone special is endearing. Shelton's lyrics warm your soul.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>2</span><h2>'Austin'</h2>"If you're callin' 'bout my heart, it's still yours / I should've listened to it a little more / Then it wouldn't have taken me so long to know where I belong / And by the way, boy, this is no machine you're talkin' to / Can't you tell, this is Austin, and I still love you"<p>Shelton's first hit still stands out as one of his best. 'Austin' is his best story-based single, although others like 'Ol' Red' and 'The Baby' certainly competed for a spot on this list. The words to this ballad are delivered so smoothly that it's almost easy to underestimate the strength of the songwriting. We didn't.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Warner Music Nashville</span></p>Warner Music Nashville<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>1</span><h2>'She Wouldn't Be Gone'</h2>"Red roadside wild flower / If I had only picked you / Took you home, set you on the counter / Oh at least a time or two / Maybe she'd have thought it through"<p>'She Wouldn't Be Gone' is almost impossible to sing along to unless you've spent significant time studying Blake Shelton's lyrics, but the song pops with color. The singer turns in one of his best performances on this soaring ballad. He shows his range, as well as his ability to tap into deep, painful memories to bring this great song to life.</p></li></ul><h2>What Are Your Favorite Blake Shelton Lyrics?</h2><p>Are there some Blake Shelton lyrics that have moved you more than one of these five?
