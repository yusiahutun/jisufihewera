The resorts and tourist facilities that sprang up on increasingly expensive plots of rugged coastal land began rubbing shoulders with mosques, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, dive shops and European bistros along Labuan Bajo’s main coastal thoroughfare, Soekarno Hatta.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among the latest sea-facing developments are a Starbucks; a giant in the Meru franchise of Indonesian five-star hotels; and a yet-to-be-completed tourist wharf esplanade complete with open-air food court.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The development carries on along the coastline well onto the Waecicu peninsula, to the town’s northwest, where a large building site now carries the Marriott hotels’ banner and real estate prices are the highest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/30/308b2c3d-ba6f-4c38-b832-74a779c25790_b12d6d37.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This inflated one-horse town is being transformed into one of the “10 new Balis” Indonesian President Joko Widodo has called for in an attempt to boost far-flung economies with tourism.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was the president himself who inaugurated the new Komodo Airport terminal in December 2015. Although in Labuan Bajo, the airport was renamed after the dragon’s main den and the new terminal is able to welcome as many as 1.5 million tourists per year. The airport’s capacity had been 150,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brakes on Labuan Bajo’s much-needed post-pandemic revival, however, could be applied by the authorities’ attempt to preserve Komodo National Park – the main source of income for the tourism-reliant town.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/30/fb57dc17-84d3-4e66-b7e8-342fdfb57595_b12d6d37.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In July, Indonesian authorities announced a twenty-five-fold hike in the park’s entry fee, from 150,000 rupiah (US$10) to 3,750,000 rupiah (US$250). Between July 28 and August 1, disappointed locals took to Labuan Bajo’s streets in peaceful protests, and threatened a month-long embargo on all tourism-related services.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the final day of the protests, a journalist and three other people were detained by authorities. For that reason – and because freedom of expression is rare in Indonesia, where harassment and threats to human rights activists and journalists are ongoing – most of the people spoken to for this article insisted on anonymity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The fact that most locals do not want to speak publicly says a lot that they are afraid of a possible retaliation,” says author and writer Andreas Harsono, who has covered Indonesia for Human Rights Watch since 2008. “It might be baseless, but it shows that there’s fear in the air.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/30/7f991a30-a2a3-46ea-9ab1-c55b52046699_39543720.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Frustration at the badly timed proposal – after two years without tourism – is understandable, but this wasn’t the first time the government had attempted to raise the fee.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The conservation of Komodo National Park has been on the agenda since 2019, when it was proposed that the park should be closed for a year to help restore the populations of dragons and deer they feed on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After local uproar, a large increase in the entry fee – to US$500, and then US$1,000 – to control visitor numbers was proposed, although neither was adopted.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Park fees are one thing, but how do they benefit the park?
