"I was like, 'I'm freaking out. I'm on this. I'm on that.' They were like, 'You need to stop. Don't tell the world that you're on drugs right now.'"</p><p>He said he managed to keep it a secret from family and friends for about 18 months, until his bandmates staged the intervention on July 8, 2001.</p><p>"The most crucial part of that conversation was the final thing Kevin [Richardson] said to me: If I continued using, he said, 'I will never trust you again. You're dead to me.'"</p><p>But AJ admitted he continued to fall on and off the wagon for the next 18 years — until one jarring encounter with his family last December snapped him out of it.</p><p>"I was never sober. Not for a second," he told GMA. "And the turning point for me was when I came back home, my wife could smell it on my breath and my youngest of my two daughters would not sit with me."</p><p>Since that day, the "DWTS" alum — who shares daughters Ava, 6, and Lyric, 3, with wife Rochelle — said he has been completely clean and sober.</p><p>"There's too much to live for today — my beautiful children, my amazing wife, my career, my brothers," he said. "I've never felt more grounded than I do today."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:82ba7ab2-26e2-4e3b-9848-b9c718c4d053 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3e5cd823-3ec0-41c8-a442-5cc90c51d0ac data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b9/5by4/2020/10/15/b9287b3f14904566bdf370631cd1a272_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Nikki Bella Says Dancing with Artem Chigvintsev on DWTS Was 'Uncomfortable' When She Was Engaged to John Cena</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7kGlmanFfl66kt9KtqZ6dpGKvsMXSZpmrp5uaeqq606hkmqJdorCtscCnZKGnpaiybq%2FOnJiippVitq%2FAxKutnqaknryvew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexander-skarsgard-kate-bosworth-split-years-dating-html.html><span>←</span><span>Alexander Skarsgard and Kate Bosworth split after two years of dating</span></a>
