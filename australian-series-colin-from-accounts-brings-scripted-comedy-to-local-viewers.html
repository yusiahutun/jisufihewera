That was a first, and initially, it was just something to make use of what felt like lost time.</p><p>A short week later, she had an earnest, bitingly witty comedy series on her hands that would eventually be snapped up for production by Australian streaming service, <a class=body-link href=#>Binge</a>.</p><p>“I was like, mate, this is actually really good,” her husband, <i>Offspring</i> dreamboat Patrick Brammall, 46, tells news.com.au of reading Dyer’s draft script for the first time.</p><p>“She had never written before, this was her first go at it. And we’re so proud of what we’ve done with it.”<br></p><p>That comedy series is the soon-to-premiere <i>Colin From Accounts</i>, which the LA-based couple both star in.</p><p>The eight-part show, which premieres with a full-season drop on December 1, marks Binge’s second original production, and its first foray into the intimidating world of scripted comedy.</p><p>Dyer, 35, plays Ashley, an all-over-the-shop medical student whose tendency to act without thinking lands her in all-too-relatable pickles (there are several toilet faux pas one would be lying if they said they couldn’t relate to).</p><p>Reeling from a dating setback, Ashley recklessly flashes her boob at a stranger, brewery owner Gordon (Brammall), while he’s driving to work, causing him to hit a stray dog.</p><p>It turns out to be somewhat of an extreme sliding doors moment; the pair finding themselves thrust together as unlikely caretakers (and bill payers) for the permanently injured hound, who they later name (you guessed it) Colin From Accounts, in a nod to millennial-era banter viewers will immediately grasp without further explanation.</p><p>The characters’ stinging one-liners and awkward <i>The Office</i> style interactions feel entirely off the cuff, and given their close relationship off-screen, it would be fair to assume a large chunk of it was improvised. But that’s not the case.</p><p>“I think 95 per cent of it is scripted actually,” Brammall says.</p><p>“We would sometimes do a few takes before they’d let us improvise a bit, but most of what you see was in the script.<br></p><p>“We wanted it to feel natural but there was a lot of effort put into the script to make it seem that way, so that’s really the biggest compliment we could receive.”</p><p></p><p>We talk at length about the belly laughs – and the smaller characters that are just as funny as the protagonists (Dyer and Brammall hired a lot of their friends for cameos) – but <i>Colin From Accounts</i> is at its core a modern-day love story. And what’s a love story without some tears?</p><p>“You can definitely expect those deeper moments,” Dyer says.<br></p><p>While it doesn’t show in the finished product, it was a difficult time to be filming a TV show. <i>Colin From Accounts</i> was shot in Sydney in early 2021 during the second Covid wave.</p><p>If one person got sick, that was it. They’d have to shut down and suffer expensive delays.</p><p>On top of all the rules and protocols of filming during an unprecedented pandemic, the pair were first-time parents with a four-month old daughter at home. Little Joni is now 14 months old.</p><p>“We would just get home late and she’d be in bed and we’d be like, ‘I hope she remembers us,’” Dyer says. “But we were very much used to working as a team.”</p><p>It’s fair to say stress shrouded the process, but it’s not the leading emotion they associate with the project.</p><p>“It was definitely a lot of work, but we just had so much fun. We really were laughing every day,” Brammall says.</p><p>“And we really put an effort into keeping morale up,” Dyer adds. “We’d play games on set, like hiding a $50 note that someone would have to find that day.</p><p>“I think, honestly, the dog was the most professional actor on set.”</p><p><b><i>Stream Colin From Accounts from December 1 on BINGE.

Sorry. Not yet. I’m manifesting,” she says, laughing. “We would love nothing more than to do another season, so fingers crossed. We’re just so excited for people to see it.”</p><p><i>Colin From Accounts premieres on Binge December 1</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmTAtb7EmqSippdkrra%2F06uYpaGRo3q0sdGinKxlk6S5qrqMn6mopV2WsKS71KerrGWSp7avs9JmqpyqmaXBprCMnKamnZSuerW7jKWmnJmcYsOqsdaeqaxnnprEtHnSraarsV9tf6KAwXBunm5hmIOjg8Sab59tk22udLCSbJprnZNpfw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bootsy-collins-steps-back-from-touring-for-health-reasons.html><span>←</span><span>Bootsy Collins Steps Back From Touring For Health Reasons</span></a>
