Wendy Williams returned from a five-week break from her talk show on Monday morning and made herself the Hot Topic of the morning with some big news: she's got a new man.
While Williams was photographed all over New York City with 27-year-old Marc Tomblin during her hiatus, she insists he's not who she's currently dating.
&#34;I'm not on the market anymore,&#34; she revealed, getting both giddy and emotional as she spoke to her studio audience."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

"Okay, mother doesn't deal with children. But it just so happens that I guess with my charm and wit, I attract people of all ages."</p><p>Addressing photos of her holding hands with Tomblin, Williams said she does that with everyone. "So Mark is new to New York and he's having panic attacks and I'm unsteady on my feet, I got the vertigo," she also added. Regarding those shots of <strong><a href=#>Tomblin holding clothing bags while out together on a shopping spree</a></strong>, Williams said he was holding her clothes.</p><p>"You's all thinking I'm messing around with a 27 year old ... I get it, but when it comes time for the comfort of a man, I need somebody in his 50s too," she then explained, getting the audience in an uproar.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:99aa6b32-eced-5eb8-887d-ae2eadd66854 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0f1417f2-4768-5abe-a04a-8536a44c4325 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9a/5by4/2019/05/14/9a28f9dc3a5d59a88ad73f4c90c8d502_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Fox</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Wendy Williams Addresses Divorce, Dating Rumors and 'Rediscovering My Love of Men'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"And he's gotta work. It helps that he's a doctor," Williams then added. "I am not gonna say one more word, you're not gonna blow this for me. But he's been married, his kids are in their 20s and yes, he's black."</p><p>She also said her new man, who shall remain nameless for now, is in great shape.</p><p>During her first episode back, Williams also addressed a headline from the Globe saying Williams was getting "sweet revenge as $50 million divorce turns ugly."</p><p>While she didn't bring up ex Kevin Hunter directly, she said only this: "When I saw this, I almost passed out right there. I bought all of them at the airport.
