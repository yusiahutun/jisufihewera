<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Is Kenny Chesney Married With Kids? Inside His Family Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Kenny Chesney</strong></a> sings about love songs with his <a href=#>ACM Award</a>-winning <a href=#>country music</a>, but thanks to the love he’s experienced throughout his life, some of his relationships have given him inspiration. Most notably, the “There Goes My Life” crooner was married to ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Renée Zellweger</strong></a> from May to September 2005, but the former Hollywood couple never went on to have kids.</p><h2>Who Was Kenny Chesney Married To?</h2><p>Perhaps Kenny and Renée’s former romance is memorable for all the wrong reasons. Though the two shared a strong connection in the beginning, the country artist’s relationship with the <a href=#>Bridget Jones’s Diary</a> alum ended as quickly as it began. The exes first met at NBC’s “Concert of Hope” telethon in January 2005, where the <a href=#>Judy</a> star developed a little bit of a crush.</p><p>According to a friend of Renée’s, the actress had intentions to make a move and “pass [Kenny] a note” during the event. However, her plans never came to fruition because she started talking to the <a href=#>Grammy</a> winner’s publicist, who passed the information along before she had the chance. “When the broadcast wrapped, [Kenny went over [to Renée] and said, ‘I hear you are trying to pass me a note — don’t let the principal find out,'” the pal once told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p>It’s no surprise the ex-lovebirds completely hit it off considering Kenny had his eyes on the Murder in the Heartland alum for years. In fact, he named Renée as one of the “three sexiest people,” along with <a href=#><strong>Charlize Theron</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Janet Jackson</strong></a>, when asked his Hollywood crush during a 2002 interview with <a href=#>The Tennessean</a>.</p><p>“Here’s a country girl who’s still down to earth. You never see her coming, then — wham! — there she is. And that makes her really, really sexy,” he told the outlet, referring to the blonde beauty. “Plus, [Renée] seems like the kind of girl who could fit in and be at home anywhere.”</p><p>After exchanging pleasantries at the NBC telethon, Kenny and the What If star’s relationship quickly took off. After keeping their romance under wraps for months, the “Knowing You” crooner and the Rebel Highway actress confirmed their status as a couple in April. Renée surprised fans during one of Kenny’s concerts when she delivered him a margarita on stage before sharing a kiss.</p><p>Just one week later, the former lovers proved how serious they were about each other when they said “I do” in May. Per <a href=#>Good Housekeeping</a>, Kenny and Renée wed in a private ceremony on the beach in the Virgin Islands. The Oscar winner looked gorgeous in a strapless, silk white gown, while the country icon sported khaki-colored pants, a white dress shirt and his signature cowboy hat.</p><p>Sadly, their love story was over just four months later in September, with Renée filing to annul their marriage. After citing “fraud” as the reason for their split, the Jerry Maguire actress clarified to <a href=#>People</a> that “the term ‘fraud,’ as listed in the documentation, is simply legal language and not a reflection of Kenny’s character.”</p><h2>Who Else Has Kenny Chesney Dated?</h2><p>Considering Kenny is extremely private when it comes to his personal life, he’s done a good job keeping his dating life out of the public eye. According to reports, he has been romantically involved with a few women since calling it quits with Renée, including Miss Tennessee 2005 <strong>Amy Colley</strong> and ESPN broadcaster <strong>Jenn Brown</strong>. He was also rumored to be dating fellow country star <strong><a id=OWA5389ee7f-3079-a8f3-8d5d-7fd99355323e class="x_OWAAutoLink x_ContentPasted7" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=14>Miranda Lambert</a></strong><span class=x_ContentPasted7>&nbsp;before she married her now-ex-husband,</span><a id=OWA03cd61a9-1f6e-9d2a-0bf4-f0b46e011b01 class="x_OWAAutoLink x_ContentPasted7" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=15>&nbsp;<strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a>, in 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/kenny-chesney-kids.jpg><h2>Who Is Kenny Chesney’s Girlfriend Mary Nolan?</h2><p>Despite his few failed romances, Kenny appears to be in a longtime relationship with a girlfriend named <strong>Mary Nolan</strong> these days. According to <a href=#>Country Thang Daily</a>, the two have been dating since 2012. Kenny and Mary have made some rare public appearances together throughout the years, but they typically keep their love story out of the spotlight.</p><h2>Does Kenny Chesney Have Kids?</h2><p>Though it’s unclear if Kenny and his lady have any plans to welcome kids, the professional guitarist once said he always had dreams of becoming a dad. “I hope I have kids one day,” he told <a href=#>Parade</a> in August 2010, noting he wouldn’t be heartbroken if it doesn’t happen. “I don’t wake up every day and miss that in my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46iqmajlaO7unnCoZysppWueq6t0augnpxdrLa1tIykoJ2rXZ67tLXDnmShoaNis6K5yKWwZqSZm7Jw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dwp-announces-the-dates-lineup-for-aftershock-2021.html><span>←</span><span>DWP Announces The Dates, Lineup For Aftershock 2021</span></a>
