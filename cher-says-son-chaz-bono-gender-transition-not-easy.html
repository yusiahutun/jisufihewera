"Then we talked about (whether Bono was) transgender for many years. And (he) would say, 'No, I don't want to (transition).' And then he went and said, 'OK, I want to do this.'"</p><p>"But it wasn't easy," she said, before admitting hearing Chaz's voice on the "old (voicemail) messages" was "very difficult."</p><p>"But you don't really lose them," she added. "They just are in a different shape."</p><p>Chaz was the first transgender person to compete on "Dancing with the Stars." He appeared in "American Horror Story," "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and several episodes of "The Bold and the Beautiful." With three books under his belt, he is also an acclaimed author.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:45bf39d6-8838-4f55-a201-46d8098c6a73 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3abac97f-e9d3-46e4-8da3-c08b323ab4d8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2e/5by4/2020/08/30/2e50190b0c144e1eb75b39b80c266b48_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Cher Wants Someone Outside of Britney Spears' Family to Look Into Her Well-Being</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>According to Cher, Chaz is now "so unbelievably happy."</p><p>In the same interview, Cher, who has long been an LGBTQ+ icon, said her first introduction to the "gay world" happened when she was 9 years old.</p><p>"One day I came home and there were these two men in my living room with my mom and my aunt.
