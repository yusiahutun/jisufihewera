The Illinois waterfowl hunting zone maps and anticipated season dates for the 2021-2025 seasons are available on the IDNR <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>website</a>.</p><p>Sunrise and sunset times are not included in the Hunting and Trapping Digest again this year. Hunters can find their local sunrises and sunsets <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>here</a>.</p><p>IDNR is working with other state and federal agencies to monitor for outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of HPAI that was observed in Illinois during the spring of 2022. Similar mortality events may occur as waterfowl arrive in Illinois from northern breeding grounds during the fall migration. IDNR reminds waterfowl hunters to take precautions and thoroughly cook game meat to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Avoid handling sick or dead waterfowl found in the field. Do not allow dogs and other pets to consume waterfowl that died from unknown causes. Further guidance for hunters can be found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>here</a>.</p><p>If five or more wild birds are found deceased of unknown causes in one location, contact an IDNR district wildlife biologist immediately. A list of IDNR district biologists and the counties they serve, along with their phone numbers and email addresses can be found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKCdpqJiv6a4xJqqnqtdnrluw8CtnKuen6y5brTUp6uippdiwrGwwK2crGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jackie-kennedy-onassis-style-0111.html><span>←</span><span>Iconic Jackie Kennedy Fashion Pictures</span></a>
