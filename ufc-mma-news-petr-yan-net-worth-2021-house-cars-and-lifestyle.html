His skills and experience as a fighter made it possible for him to gain recognition within a short span of time. The Russian mixed martial artist has fought and won against great fighters like Jimmie Rivera, Urijah Faber, and Jose Aldo. He has an eminent professional fighting record of 15 wins and 2 losses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The only two losses he has suffered in his career were against Aljamain Sterling and Magomed Magomedov. Controversies surrounded the outcome of both these fights. In the bout against Magomedov, many felt ‘No Mercy’ was the true winner. Meanwhile, the Sterling fight ended in a DQ loss.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1075810234.jpg><p>As MMA fans believe Yan was the better fighter, it <span>speaks volumes about the trust and belief that his viewers have in his skills.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Yan began Taekwondo training early in life. This explains his command over combat sports. With several years of training, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Yan</a> successfully achieved the level of Master of Sport in Boxing. Furthermore, he is a BJJ blue belt.&nbsp;</span></p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-ufc-mma-news-is-he-even-awake-yet-or-still-sleeping-colby-covington-destroys-jorge-masvidal-for-calling-him-fragile?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20201223212343/GettyImages-1159311100-473x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">“Is He Even Awake Yet or Still Sleeping?”- Colby Covington Destroys Jorge Masvidal for Calling Him Fragile</p></a><p><span>He was a famous fighter back in his home country, Russia. But later, he burst into the UFC scene and shocked the international audience with his talent. As a result of his exciting fights and good pay, the UFC’s #10 pound-for-pound fighter enjoys a grand lifestyle as well. However, there is no information about his house.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>What is Petr Yan’s net worth?</strong></h2><p><span>Yan has an estimated net worth of around <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>$1.5 million</a> in 2021. For a fighter in just his late 20s, his career and net worth are worthy of envy. ‘No Mercy’ makes most of his money from his fights. His first UFC fight got him a generous amount of about $20,000 to show and another $20,000 to win. His fight against Aljamain Sterling saw him <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>earn</a> $150,000. Yan’s most lucrative fight came against Jose Aldo at UFC 251. He made $230,000 for his efforts on Fight Island.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Yan’s other sources of income may include endorsement deals with Reebok, Venum, and Gorilla Energy Drink. He is sponsored by Parimatch. It is also possible that he may have undisclosed assets from his previous ACA career.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Watch this story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Five Times Andrei Arlovski Obliterated His Opponents Inside the UFC Octagon</a></strong></p><p><span>There is not much information about what and how many cars <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Petr Yan</a> owns.
