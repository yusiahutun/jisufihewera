He said he wanted everyone to know that we were a couple.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Things were going fast in our relationship, at dinner that night we both said that we were going to be exclusive to each other. I was so excited about him. We had a picture taken of us and I told him I was going to post it on Facebook and that made him really happy.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But after Steinmetz posted the picture of them on Facebook and changed her status as 'in a relationship', things starting to unravel.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'After I posted the picture of us on Facebook things kind of hit the fan. The next morning, (Tuesday, January 19th) a friend of mine texted me asking for his name. I told her his name and she said he looked very familiar. But I reassured my friend I already knew about his ex-wife's name and had checked him out.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But within minutes my friend started to bombard me with multiple screenshots of his wedding, with a women who was not the 'wife' he told me of. She sent me a post where Jason wished his wife, happy anniversary in September 2020.'</p>It's still hard for me to reconcile who he was and who he actually is. Everything single thing out of his mouth was a lie.&nbsp; Cecily Steinmetz&nbsp;&nbsp;<p class=mol-para-with-font>Steinmetz said her friend was also friends with Jason's current wife, Opal, and they had been Facebook friends for years, albeit not great friends.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was crushed. I was also humiliated because I literally just had posted this the night before and I didn't want to have to backtrack and look stupid basically that I posted a picture of being in a relationship with a married man. I immediately texted him forwarding him all of these screenshots from his wife's Facebook account that my friend had sent to me.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He finally admitted that that was his ''other'' ex and the marriage was ''annulled.'''</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Jason said her name was Opal and that their marriage was short-lived because of a ''bad incident.'''</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But I told Jason if the marriage was annulled why were these posts about their marriage from as early as September 2020 if it was annulled in 2016.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Steinmetz said she was livid and wanted to talk on the phone with Jason about it, but he said he couldn't talk because he was working in a ''school zone'' at the time. He finally called her but got off the phone with a work excuse within minutes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Jason then texted me back and said that he's trying to get his annulment paperwork and he was going to send it to me. That made me feel a little better, knowing that the marriage was actually annulled and he was going to send me the paperwork.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'A few minutes later Jason sent me the document. I told him I was going to do an open records request just to make sure, he was taken back that but said okay.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Still not trusting of her new boyfriend, Steinmetz asked him if there was anyone else who could 'vouch' for him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I asked Jason for him to put me in touch with his brother, but he said he was in a meeting. Then he suggested that I speak directly with Opal.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Jason then sent me her number and I started to text her asking about the relationship. Opal confirmed back that they have been divorced since 2016. I told this person I just wanted to make sure Jason wasn't married because I didn't want to be a homewrecker. This Opal assured me they weren't together and said he was a great guy and I should go ahead and go for it with him.'</p><img id=i-2c8126049355a43c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/02/01/15/38595040-9210377-Love_rat_Collier_is_married_and_has_four_children_but_that_appar-a-14_1612192584070.jpg height=472 width=630 alt="Collier and Steinmetz went on a weekend getaway to New Mexico where she said he spoke of marriage at lest 50 times" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Collier and Steinmetz went on a weekend getaway to New Mexico where she said he spoke of marriage at lest 50 times&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img id=i-a212d688372d0c9d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/02/01/21/38754662-9210377-image-m-73_1612215797179.jpg height=665 width=634 alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Steinmetz called him a 'poor representative' of the town he served, alleging that he would drive to visit her an hour away in Amarillo when he was on shift</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I then asked this person who I thought was Opal about the Facebook posts from the past four years.
