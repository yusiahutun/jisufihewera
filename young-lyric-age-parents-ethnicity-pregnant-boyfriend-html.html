The rapper&nbsp;belonging to an Afro-American ethnicity&nbsp;was rumored to have had an abortion, and she was alleged with the doing by non-other than&nbsp;the fellow rapper Miss Mullato.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Miss Mulatto, who is famous for winning the TV rap show “The Rap Game”</a>&nbsp;uploaded a video on YouTube on January 23, 2017, revealing that Lyric had an abortion. She criticized Lyric's success and even&nbsp;mauled Lyric's parents in the video via the lyrics of her rap.</p><p><strong>Miss Mulatto disses&nbsp;Young Lyric through her rap "Miss Mulatto- Response Diss"&nbsp;</strong>(Published on Jan 23, 2017 ) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Well, it looks like the teenagers Lyric and Mulatto has something messy going on, but it might&nbsp;still be inappropriate to pull their parents into their&nbsp;imbroglio.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Moreover, the video shared by Mulatto caused quite a stir in the media regarding Lyric's pregnancy. Lyric's fans and followers were all in questions if Lyric had undergone an abortion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But the teen rapper Lyric simply answered her followers by&nbsp;denying&nbsp;the accusations of being pregnant through a Twitter post on 23rd January. There she&nbsp;said that she had no idea who got&nbsp;the abortion.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p>And when the humhum started increasing, Lyric&nbsp;even claimed that the accusations of&nbsp;Miss Mulato were a lie. She tweeted scripting it as, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p>However, Miss Mulatto insisted on her tell and tweeted stating that Lyric was actually&nbsp;pregnant and was also beaten by her parents.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>More to the point, Young lyrics&nbsp;left no stone unturned to fend away the allegations of being pregnant. After months of those accusations, Lyric denied the rumors where she said,&nbsp;</p><p>"Does it look like I m gonna come&nbsp;home and say I got a baby in my&nbsp;stomach and if she(Mulatto) was smart she would know that&nbsp;my mama wouldn't even take me for an abortion, she would punch me. "</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Young Lyric denies rumors&nbsp;regarding pregnancy,&nbsp;abortion&nbsp;</strong>(Published on Jul 15, 2017 )</p><p>Furthermore,&nbsp;Young Lyric again slammed the&nbsp;rumors in November 2017 via a video where she&nbsp;elucidates her fans that the&nbsp;allegations&nbsp;are fake. Saying that she has had no kids and it sounds senseless when people ask her about having a child,&nbsp;Lyric explained,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>I don’t have no daughter I don’t have no kids, stop asking me thatlike, &nbsp;that sounds so retarted. Did you all ever see me with a baby in my stomach,, please! cuz last time I checked you have to cary a baby for nine months, now did I do that? Just stop the asking stuff that don’t even make sense.</p><p><strong>Young Lyric&nbsp;on pregnancy&nbsp;</strong>(Published on Nov 8, 2017 )</p><p>Well, looking back at Lyric's&nbsp;say and claims, it seems like the 17-year-old rapper was never actually pregnant. The accusations sound surreal, and the news is possibly&nbsp;just a rumor as&nbsp;the news about Lyric's possible boyfriend has&nbsp;not surfaced out in the media yet. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZrKnpaO0brjYq6CcZZGcsm68wKucp6yjYrK1tM2imqKsqWK9s7HGp5inrF2XvLqy0aKcp5xencGuuA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./los-angeles-police-officer-accused-racism-arrested-django-unchained-actress-faces-demand-10-000-leaked-recording-incident-html.html><span>←</span><span>LA police officer who arrested Daniele Watts faces fine of for leaking recording</span></a>
