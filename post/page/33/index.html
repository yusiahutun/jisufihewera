I try to believe my skincare routine actually does something, if only for the modicum of control it offers over the world. So it was disappointing to step out of the shower the other day and see little, pilled-up balls of dead skin remain after using a body scrub. Clearly it failed at its one job, so it might be time for me to pick up an exfoliating mitt — and I have my eye on one $8 find that more than 16,500 people love.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Best Sea Salt Sprays of 2024</h2><time>Aug 9, 2024</time>

I have to be completely honest here, I've never been completely happy with Windows File Explorer. I think the last time I actually liked the graphical layout of a Windows file system was Windows 3.1. Seriously.
What I liked about it was how accessible everything was on a single screen. Everything was in well-organized squares of data, so productivity was better in my opinion.
