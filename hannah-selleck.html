Is She Married?</h2><p>Truly, lucky are those who are blessed with parents like <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Tom Selleck</strong></a> and <strong>Jillie Mack</strong> who gave up everything including their Hollywood lifestyle for the sake of their daughter whom they wanted to provide a safe and sound future and life from the eagled-eyed media and people.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/04/10/hannah-selleck-glaunts-her-figure-in-a-black-dress-at-an-event--1586536880.jpg width=450 height=675 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Hannah Selleck flaunts her figure in a black dress at an event. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Zimbio</span></strong><p>Hannah's parents have been <a href=# rel=noopener>married for unbelievably three decades</a> with sharing every up and down together, especially for their beloved daughter whom they welcomed a year later they walked down the aisle. In fact, it was after the birth of Hannah, Tom temporarily gave up on Hollywood to dedicate more of his time to his family. That was actually a bitter lesson he learned from his first marriage and divorce.</p><p>Well, Hannah's father was previously married to <strong>Jacqueline Ray</strong>, but the busy acting life of Tom took a toll over his first marriage. Not to mention, Hannah also shares a half-brother from his father's side. <strong>Kevin Selleck</strong>, son of Jillie and her previous partner, who was later adopted by Tom.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/04/10/hannah-selleck-as-seen-alongside-her-father-tom-selleck-and-mother-pinterest-jillie-mack--1586537088.png width=450 height=318 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Hannah Selleck as seen alongside her father Tom Selleck and mother Pinterest Jillie Mack. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Pinterest</span></strong><p>As you see, Tom didn't want to repeat the same mistake with his second marriage, which is why he moved from the LA city to live a country lifestyle in an avocado-farm ranch where Hannah grew up and developed a passion for horse riding. Not to mention, Hannah's parents make decisions only based on what is appropriate for their daughter.</p><p>Hannah's parents' love life is well known to everyone. But what about the world-class show jumper?</p><h3>Hannah Selleck Is Private; Fell In Love With Horses Though</h3><p>Learned from the best aka her mom and dad, she is extremely secretive. Hannah Selleck, however, isn't married yet. Of course, this gorgeous woman has a lot of men fallen for her beauty and skills, and whoever ends up marrying Selleck would be safe to consider one in a million.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/04/10/horse-riding-will-always-be-hannah-selleck-s-first-love--1586537468.jpg width=450 height=597 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Horse riding will always be Hannah Selleck's first love. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Pinterest</span></strong><p>And, although it's safe to say that Hannah might have dated other men in the pasts or could be in a relationship, she really does take the cake on letting the world know nothing of her private affairs. Also, if Hannah who stands at a decent height was dating anyone or married to her husband, the world would surely hear of it one way or another.</p><p>After all, she is the daughter and the only child of Tom Selleck. But, above all, one is thing is certain, horse riding will always be her first true love.</p><h2>Earning & Career Of Hannah Selleck</h2><p>Having gotten the taste of horse riding at the age of four to learning to ride it at 12 to taking equestrianism as her profession at 14, Hannah Selleck has come a long way.

One of her loyal customers includes Meredith Herman’s Burgundy Farms.</p><p></p><p>Interestingly, after finishing college, Hannah also did an internship at a public relations firm for six months.
