Gustin, who began his acting career on Broadway, has since become one of the most popular comics, film, and serial actors and has won several Kids’ Choice and Teen Choice Awards.</p><p>Read on to learn more about Grant Gustin Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Is He Gay?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Grant Gustin Biography (Age)</strong></h2><p>Thomas Grant Gustin was born in Norfolk, Virginia, on January 14, 1990, the son of Tina Haney and Thomas Gustin. His father Thomas was a college professor, while his mother Tina worked as a pediatric nurse.</p><p>From a very young age, Gustin was very involved in art. While attending Granby High School, his parents enrolled him at the Governor’s School for the Arts for Music Theater in Norfolk. At the same time, he also attended the theater organization Hurrah Players Incorporated before graduating from high school in 2008.</p><p>After graduating, Gustin applied to Elon University in North Carolina to participate in their BFA Music Theater Program. He spent two years in college before he dropped out to join the cast of the Broadway Revival Tour of West Side Story, where he played the role of Baby John. Gustin performed on the tour for over a year before taking on the role of Sabastian Smythe in the Fox Network musical-comedy-drama series Glee (2011-2013).</p><p>After attracting the attention of television executives through his previous roles, Grant Gustin was given roles in A Mother’s Nightmare by Lifetime Network and the independent film Affluenza in 2012. The following year he was cast for the role of Campbell Price in 90210 and Barry Allen in the second season of Arrow.</p><p>It was his role in the latter that propelled him to greater heights as it earned him the lead role in the spin-off series entitled The Flash. The Flash pilot premiered in October 2014 with record views for a CW network show in more than five years. This prompted the station to order additional episodes, and since October 2018 the series is still running and is in its fifth season. The Barry Allen/Flash character has moved on to episodes of Super Girl and Legends of Tomorrow.</p><p>While continuing to play his award-winning Barry Allen role, Grant Gustin has appeared in the films Krystal (2017) and Tom and Grant (2018).</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Chad Gable Biography, Wife, Height, Weight, Parents</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Grant Gustin Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Grant Gustin is estimated to have a net worth of $2 million as of 2024, according to the Celebrity Net Worth website. The actor, who will certainly be worth much more in the coming years as his profile continues to grow, has been able to accumulate his wealth from his various acting roles. It is not clear whether Gustin will receive royalties for the songs he sang when he was still in the cast of Glee, and also for the songs he worked on in Flash.</p><p>Through his role in Glee, the former music theater student performed songs such as Uptown Girl, Bad, and Smooth Criminal, among others, which appeared on several Glee music compilations. Smooth Criminal, performed with Santana Lopez, the character from Riviera Naya, reached its peak at #26 on the Billboard Hit 100 and #10 on the Billboard Digital Songs charts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is He Gay?</strong></h2><p>Grant Gustin is not gay. Some fans have questioned his sexuality in the past, mainly because of his good performance in the role of openly gay Sebastian Smythe in Glee. Apart from this role, there are no other clues or stories that have led to credible evidence that Gustin is gay.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Does He Have A Wife?</strong></h2><p>If you needed more evidence to believe the fact that Grant Gustin is not gay, how about the fact that he is engaged to marry his American-Malaysian girlfriend Andrea Thoma, a physical therapist and fitness Instagram influencer?</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who is Luke Wilson, Is He Married, Who is His Wife?

A year and a few months later, on April 29, 2017, to be exact, the couple announced their engagement to the public through an Instagram post where Thoma, popularly known as LA, displayed her diamond ring. According to some reports, the couple held a traditional marriage ceremony in Thoma’s home country and hopes to have a formal ceremony in America in 2018.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height</strong></h2><p>Grant Gustin is one of the film stars with the most attractive body ensembles.
