"Better Off Gone" captures that gut-punch feeling of when a relationship has to come to an end&nbsp;so one party can chase something bigger.</p><p>"We all knew she was too good for Kansas / She swears we’ll end up together in the end / But she wouldn’t have to say that / If she really thought that, the fact is / She ain’t comin’ back again," Mize sings.</p><p>Few tracks instantly stick in your mind and evoke such emotion on the first play. This is one of them.</p><p>Abe Stoklasa and Donovan Woods co-wrote "Better Off Gone," and their songwriting is full of vivid imagery like the radio turning to static and slipping off a leather jacket. They’ve navigated conflicting emotions over doing the right thing and knowing how painful it will end up being.</p><p>A punchy drum backbeat supports echoes of Mize’s gravelly voice singing “better off gone” like a mantra. Great country songs tell stories, and this one leaves a lump in your throat. Then you hit repeat, again and again.</p><p>Catch Logan Mize on <a href=#>tour</a>&nbsp;throughout the U.S. this spring and summer.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Logan Mize's great uncle was Billy Mize, widely credited for helping to pioneer the Bakersfield sound.</p><p><h3>Logan Mize's "Better Off Gone" Lyrics:</h3></p><p>That girl's got her eyes on a fadin' horizon / Here come the last line of our favorite song / The end of an era / She's gonna tear up / That interstate on her way to Charleston</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>She's gone movin' on / Takin' off my leather jacket / She gonna drive as far as she can tonight / She gonna sleep on the roadside / She'll know when our hometown country station turns to static / She ain't ever been that far from home / But I know she's better off gone / Better off, better off gone / Better off, better off gone / Better off, better off gone / Better off, better off gone</p><p>We all knew that she was too good for Kansas / She swears we'll end up together in the end / But she wouldn't have to say that / If she really thought that fact is / She ain't comin' back again</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><p>Only good thing I ever had / Just up and gone away like that / I love her enough to not hold on / It's gonna break my heart but I'll get along / 'Cause she's better off gone</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><p><strong>Jimmie Allen's New RISERS Performance Is So Much Fun</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpaeXlrtuuciznGaalanBpr6MqJ2fZZeku6Z7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aarya-season-3-part-2-review-sushmita-sen-led-crime-thriller-remains-gripping-despite-convenient-writing-1277317.html><span>←</span><span>Aarya Season 3 Part 2 Review: Sushmita Sen led crime-thriller remains gripping despite convenient wr</span></a>
