Air China carries passengers to Beijing from both New York and Los Angeles, as well as a route to Shenzhen from the latter US city. China Eastern Airlines flies between Shanghai and New York, along with a round trip from Shanghai to Los Angeles.

He also posited ongoing tensions between China and the US have affected economic flows, which has had a downstream effect on business travel.</p>Air China, China Eastern and China Southern still reported aggregate losses of 12.6 billion yuan (US$1.72 billion) in the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">first half of this year</span></a>, although the amount is significantly lower than the 49.7 billion yuan in losses the three incurred over the same period last year.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even with subsidies from local governments to boost demand and economic activity, Tse said, Chinese airlines are thus likely to remain cautious about resuming international flights.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is unlikely that they would operate routes that result in financial losses.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksqS7zaiksmeTnbavrYyemqimn6LGcK3RraCcpJVkgHN%2FlHBraWedpL%2BmecOiqZ6bpGKwqbXNmmSuq12buaqzx62qZqCfp7a7u81mqZ6spae7bn6PanBmrKKWs6e1wmadmqpdoryzsYydoKyskaPB</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dupes-for-makeup.html><span>←</span><span>Dupes for Makeup and Skin Care That's Been Permanently Discontinued</span></a>
