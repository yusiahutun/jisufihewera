Crackers that are completely natural, have no funky or suspicious ingredients and also don’t cost more than pennies?

There are <a href=#>melted toffee bits and pound-of-chocolate brownie-like discs</a> that require half a glass of milk for a single bite and there are snappy little sables called <a href=#>Punitions</a>. There are <a href=#>peanut butter cookies</a> with chocolate pieces, peanut butter pieces and tiny chunks of peanuts in them and there are toasty little <a href=#>twice-baked shortbreads</a> with scraped vanilla beans inside. There are <a href=#>pecan squares</a> on shortbread bases boasting nine sticks of butter and two pounds of pecans and there are these: brown butter, brown sugar shorties.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2560 height=1707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/veselkas-cabbage-soup-scaled.jpg alt decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> <a href=#>Shuna</a> introduced me to this soup. I think it was July 2007 and she’d gathered a bunch of food bloggers at <a href=#>Veselka</a>, a Ukranian diner in the East Village famous for serving awesome beer-blotting food like borsht, stuffed cabbage and pierogis around the clock. It was hot and humid out, however, so the thought of anything besides a grilled kielbasa, pickles and a cold beer seemed insane, and yet there was our host, ordering cabbage soup.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=1867 height=1240 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2008/11/dark-chocolate-tart-with-gingersnap-crust.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I know that a lot of you think that I break my back in the kitchen each week, slaving over the most exacting steps in this recipe or that. But the fact is, I get more lax every year. I don’t feel as badly when things don’t go perfectly and I don’t feel any need to prove my cooking prowess by making my own pâte feuilletée when it will probably keep me cooking until midnight.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=500 height=332 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/05/cabbage-apple-and-walnut-salad1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Today might have started off as Pie for Breakfast Day but I think we all know that the day after Thanksgiving is all about detox. Away with the heavy cream! Begone, you cheesy gratins! Skedaddle, you deep, gooey casseroles, sticky-sweet yams topped with charred marshmallows and green beans with fried onions. Please, don’t make me eat that butter and drippings-laden gravy again… at least until tomorrow.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=500 height=332 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/05/pumpkin-cupcakes1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Oh, people. I know you’re pumpkin-ed out and it is not even Thanksgiving yet. But if there could be room in your gullet for one more pumpkin love — perhaps even as a last minute, the-heck-with-pie, Hail Mary pass of a Thanksgiving meal dessert — I think that these wee cakes are a worthy cause.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=500 height=332 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/05/pie-crust-103-rolling-and-crimping1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe, Tips</span></a><p>[Previous episodes: <a href=#>Pie Crust 101</a> & <a href=#>Pie Crust 102</a>]</p><p>As you wish, my friends.</p><p>So, <a href=#>when we left off</a>, you had all realized how much fun and easy it was to make pie dough at home, in no time flat while dirtying less than ten dishes. I suspect that each and every one of you ran to your fridge to pull out the ingredients and ten minutes later had your doughs neatly chilling back inside them. And now, all that it is left is getting those babies rolled out and filled with <a href=#>pumpkin</a> or <a href=#>apple</a> or <a href=#>cherries</a> or <a href=#>lemon</a> or … gah, I just hope you share with me.</p><p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=3072 height=2048 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2008/11/all-butter-really-flaky-pie-dough.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe, Tips</span></a> I don’t believe in perfection, in life or in the kitchen. At best, everything we do is a work in progress that gets a tad closer each time we nudge and tweak it. Case in point, last year’s <a href=#>Pie Crust 101</a> tutorial: My goal was to convince dough-phobes that they <i>needn’t fear the crust</i> by showing how I made mine in five minutes flat, or seriously, way less time than one would spend buying one.
