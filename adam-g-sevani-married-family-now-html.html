The two reportedly were dating at the time. However, the alleged romance did not live long enough as Miley started dating <a href=# rel=follow>Liam Hemsworth</a>,&nbsp;who wifed her up the same year. So it is up for discussion whether Adam and Miley were dating at the time when.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Related To Miley And Liam:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Liam Hemsworth & Miley Cyrus Are Married! A Wedding Over Christmas</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>In the same year, it was speculated that Adam was dating Montana Tucker. But it was merely speculation without any proper evidence to back it up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Similarly, he was rumored to be <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dating</a> Alyson Stoner at one point. But, the rumors turned out to be baseless speculation as neither of them ever confirmed it.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Since then, nothing about his dating life has been seen on the internet. With him being hush about his romantic life, there was an assumption brewing about Adam being gay. He even tweeted calling himself out&nbsp;in 2012.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=181 style="margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:970px;float:none!important;margin-left:auto!important;display:block!important;text-align:center!important;min-width:970px;min-height:400px;max-width:970px;line-height:0;padding:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important"></span>But, the tweet was about him watching the TV show called Pretty Little Liars. He wrote,</p><p style=text-align:justify>"Call me gay, I don't care. But I actually watched the Pretty Little Liars summer finale tonight.. These girls are.. damn ;) haha"</p><p style=text-align:justify>Based on Adam’s past alleged flings, one could assume that he is not gay. But then again, the actor&nbsp;has not confirmed or denied any of the speculations. And now, as of 2022, it is still very unclear&nbsp;if he already has a wife living the best married life behind the cameras or is he still single.</p><p style=text-align:justify>With little to no information on his wife and current romantic life, we can still feel a connection towards the actor by knowing his well-earned credentials. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=183 style="margin-right:auto!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-height:400px;max-width:970px;float:none!important;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;display:block!important;text-align:center!important;line-height:0;width:970px;margin-bottom:15px!important;min-width:970px"></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Career & Net Worth</h2><p style=text-align:justify>With such a fantastic skill as a dancer, Adam Sevani has made quite the name for himself. He was first seen in the JC Penney: 2004 Back to School commercial in 2004 when he was about 12 years of age.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>His major debut turned out to be the movie Step Up 2: The Streets in 2008, portraying the character ‘Moose.’ Earning the rightful attention through his dancing, he was again cast as the same character in the sequels of the Step Up franchise named Step Up 3D, Step Up Revolution, and Step Up All In.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Adam G.
