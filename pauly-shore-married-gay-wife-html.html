However, after his acting career began to wane in the late 1990s, the man with the never-say-die mentality shifted his focus to becoming a comedian.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>The actor, who is most renowned for his top-notch comic timing, has not only garnered applause but has had to deal with some sad outcomes. He has hit the headlines for his works and his womanizing abilities, as he has charmed several ladies.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Despite his waning career, he&nbsp;has managed to stay in the news, thanks to his confusing social media rants about his sexuality. Whether his film is a hit or a disaster, the actor understands how to get the people's attention and become the star of the show.</p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Not Married: No Wife But Has A Girlfriend?&nbsp;</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shore </a>grew popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s following a string of smashes. However, the&nbsp;Encino Man star has had infamous romantic patterns throughout his stellar acting career. Tiffani Thiessen and Kylie Minogue are just a handful of the well-known women he has dated in the entertainment business.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>See Also:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Chace Crawford Has Wife Or Casually Dating Girlfriend? Explicit Details</a></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>In 1997, they met on producing his film Biodome, which Kylie regarded as her "worst career move." The actor recounts his happy days with her in a chat with The Daily Telegraph, noting how he fell madly in love with her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>“I didn’t know who she was and she didn’t know who I was and we just had a great time together. I just fell in love with her personality. I’m like, ‘Oh my God, this girl’s adorable”</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>The career downfall of the American actor has been exceptional, and one of the primary reasons is said to be the anguish he experienced following the murder of his ex-girlfriend, Shannon Wilsey. After an accident disfigured her entire face, the adult film actress committed suicide in 1994, just after splitting up with him.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In a 1994 interview with The Los Angeles Times, the filmmaker expressed his sorrow at the loss of his ex-girlfriend.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>“She was the nicest, most beautiful girl I ever met, It was a very dramatic thing for me.”</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>The actor, who is far past his prime, is currently in a low-key relationship status. On the other hand, the star was once witnessed having PDA with an unknown girl who is said to be his girlfriend.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Pauly Shore involved in a PDA with the girlfriend</strong>&nbsp;(Photo: dailymail.co.uk) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>In October 2015, the 53-year-old comic was spotted resting on the beaches of Miami with his younger sweetheart.</p><p style=text-align:justify>To sum up, Shore is not married, at least as far as we know. Though roamers claim he is gay, yet could be proven false because he has had records of several girlfriends throughout the years.</p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Gay Or Not: Son In Law Star Sparks Gay Rumors With Social Media Post</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>After making news for his PDA-filled trip on Miami's beaches, he vanished from the public view many times after that.

Not only that but because of his other relationship, the matter has been brought up. He was also reported to be in a relationship with partner Alex Noble. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>With his long list of ex-girlfriends, these reports come as a huge surprise. Yet, the actor might move to restore a career that appears to be on the decline. With both of his parents having hailed from a comic family and the actor boasting an unmatched sense of humor, that post might well be one of his jokes.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-186 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>After all, the Alone Together star is presently participating in various stand-up comedy performances in the hopes of reviving his career.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>You May Also Like:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Openly Gay James Charles, Exceptional Makeup Artist Boyfriend | Dating?</a></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>The Pauly Shore Is Dead actor, Paul Montgomery Shore, who faked his own death in the film to resurrect his career in 2003, might well be reeling off another career rebirth with his social media presence.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Want to follow the latest happenings in your favorite celebrity's life?
