At the age of fifteen, Rory Feek learned to play the guitar in high school.</p><p>After high school, Rory served in the United States Marine Corps for eight years. As proud as Rory is of his service to his country, he has always had a passion for music, which is why he returned to the music industry after his service. He decided to follow his dreams and moved to Dallas, Texas. Rory chose Texas to start his career because of the music scene that developed there. In the mid 90’s he rented an apartment in Dallas in the hope of finding an agent or employee.</p><p>To make ends meet, Rory performed in several nightclubs and bars. During this time he met several up-and-coming artists like him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Rory Feek </strong><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Rory Feek currently has total net assets of $3 million. This is the result of his long and dedicated career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>His songwriting career has been inspired by Merle Haggard, Don Williams, and several others. When Rory returned from the Marine Corps, he lived in Dallas, Texas. After Texas, he moved to Nashville in 1995 on the advice of Rod Phelps – a lawyer from Nashville Entertainment. While in Nashville, he signed a publishing contract and soon after released his first single as a songwriter. One of his early releases included Someone You Used to Know by Collin Rate. The song was a critical and commercial hit and even became a top-five country hit. He also co-wrote The Chain Of Love by Clay Walker, which was also another top-five country song.</p><p>Other artists he has written for include Kenny Chesney, Tracey Byrd, Lorrie Morgan, Mark Wills, Terri Clark, and Randy Travis.

Shortly after, I Will – a song Rory co-wrote for Jimmy Wayne – also made it into the charts.</p><p>There’s no denying that Rory Feek is pretty good at what he does and he deserves every penny of his net worth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>First Wife, Daughters & Children</strong></h2><p>On 3 August 1985 Rory married his first wife – Tamara Gilmer.
