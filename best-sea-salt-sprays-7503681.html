This tousled look is laidback in a way that makes us feel like we’re living in a California daydream — no swimsuit or sunscreen required — and it’s a lifesaver when we don’t have our trusty styling tools on hand. All you really need to get perfectly undone waves is a good sea salt spray and some easy styling tips. These sprays are so low-maintenance and easy to use, you might even break up with your blow dryer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help you get textured waves worthy of a close-up, we combed through an ocean of options to find the best sea salt sprays for every budget and hair type. The following products have been tested and vetted by our team, and are recommended by celebrity hairstylists who swear by their fuss-free formulas.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-rahua-enchanted-island-salt-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rahua Enchanted Island Salt Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ENCHANTED ISLAND&amp;acirc;&amp;cent; SALT SPRAY" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/cJVfaV0FybHb0BurO5SKtU23Nio=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/enchanted-island-salt-spray-506b152eafea46b6914c6d15e1d43b5b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rahua</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This spray creates soft, volumized waves and features a refreshing tropical fragrance.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t provide a very strong hold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rahua uses the highest quality ingredients sourced from the Amazon rainforest to create products that help us achieve salon-worthy results at home. One of our favorites is the Enchanted Island Salt Spray. Like the name suggests, it magically gives us voluminous island beach waves with just a few spritzes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made with detoxifying pink sea salt, hydrating guava, and pH-balancing passion fruit, this spray’s luscious, tropical scent immediately drew us in, but the results keep us coming back for more. Along with delivering a supermodel-esque tousled look, it softens and strengthens hair, so we’re never left with any stickiness or crunch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Simply mist through damp hair to add texture and light hold. We find ourselves misting every few hours when we want extra body and grit, but truthfully, we don’t mind because the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>intoxicating fragrance</a> boosts our mood, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All<strong> </strong>|<strong> Size: </strong>4.2 oz&nbsp;| <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Pink sea salt, guava, hibiscus, passion fruit</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-not-your-mothers-beach-babe-texturizing-sea-salt-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Not Your Mother’s Texturizing Sea Salt Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Not Your Mother&amp;acirc;s Beach Babe Texturizing Sea Salt Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YR6R6ZZMqmD8zRDXbEOKROXWrUc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Not-Your-Mothers-Beach-Babe-Texturizing-Sea-Salt-Spray-4833ecc3764a4aad862c0f1dcd378faa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Beyond giving hair a soft, beachy texture, it also offers UV protection at an affordable price.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It has a strong coconut scent that’s not for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A longtime staple for beach babes and hairstylists alike, this sea salt spray offers just the right amount of volume, texture, and grit — all at a super-affordable price, to boot. We love the easy-to-use spray nozzle, which makes it a cinch to pump up hair at the roots or mist from a distance.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To create messy, separated waves with a matte finish, just spritz this through damp hair and scrunch it up. The formula also provides UV protection to keep hair safe from the sun. And even if you’re nowhere near a beach, the coconut scent will transport you to the tropics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>8 oz | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Dead sea salt, sea kelp</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-oribe-aprs-beach-wave-and-shine-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Oribe Après Beach Wave and Shine Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Oribe Apr&amp;Atilde;&amp;uml;s Beach Wave and Shine Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yTUnR_K6EE33ixrdlB0I-Xa-6mo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Oribe-Apres-Beach-Wave-and-Shine-Spray-81fd0119621b4157a834a1693c443ec6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This moisturizing spray delivers texture and shine without making hair look stiff.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s more of a texturizer than a wave-maker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Calling all bohemian goddesses: Oribe’s Aprés Beach Wave and Shine Spray is one of the most luxe and effective picks on the market. We love its moisturizing formula, which includes a blend of exotic oils that give strands a silky texture while protecting them from free radical damage. Along with the spray itself, the fine nozzle enhances the experience with a pinpointed application that helps create a piecey texture for all hair types, from baby-fine strands to thicker curls.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, beyond the texturizing effect and the shine-boosting qualities, the spray doesn’t create waves so much as it enhances them. If you have stick-straight hair, you may want to add waves with curlers or an iron before using this to finish your look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type:</strong> All<strong> | Size: </strong>8.5 oz<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Oribe signature complex (watermelon, lychee and edelweiss flower), safflower seed oil, ginger root extract</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-ogx-moroccan-sea-salt-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>OGX Moroccan Sea Salt Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="OGX Moroccan Sea Salt Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/me_Xz0hAhyhCLWShKTxwvB7V9sU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/OGX-Moroccan-Sea-Salt-Spray-1fb6c779369945a283ed8a6c3d0c64ae.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Simple and effective, this formula features moisturizing argan oil that leaves hair feeling extra hydrated.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s formulated for normal to oily hair, so it’s not ideal for those with dry or damaged strands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some of our favorite beauty products are the ones we pick up at the drugstore, and OGX’s Moroccan Sea Salt Spray is one of the mainstays you’ll find in our basket year after year. Its straightforward formula makes the most of naturally-derived ingredients like argan oil and sea kelp that are known for their hydrating and shine-promoting properties. Meanwhile, a generous amount of sea salt helps create the messy, beachy texture we crave.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another notable ingredient — citric acid — helps to balance the scalp’s pH, but it can be harsh on dry or damaged strands. Those with normal to oily hair can (and should) use this product to their heart’s content.&nbsp;Pro tip: Flip your hair upside-down and spritz your roots for additional volume.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>Normal to oily<strong> | Size: </strong>6 oz<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Sea kelp, Moroccan argan oil</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-straight-hair-rco-rockaway-salt-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Straight Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>R+Co Rockaway Salt Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="R+Co Rockaway Salt Spray, Adds Volume and Hair Texture" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6K3sTjhbQYjGITtJBtfOcqMBOVg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/r-co-rockaway-salt-spray-adds-volume-and-hair-texture-4f87275423ba4026b29d2ddacb2587f1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This spray adds major texture and volume to all hair types — plus, it looks classy on our vanity.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It can feel a bit crunchy if you apply too much.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Almost every hairstylist we interviewed recommends R+Co products, but this sea salt spray was by far the most mentioned. Rockaway Salt Spray creates tousled texture and buildable volume to make you look like you just spent the day on the water. It also includes vitamin C and balm mint to prevent color-fading.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It can feel a little crunchy if you go overboard on application, but Tennessee-based hairstylist Tyler Chase Bishop has a tip that will fix that in a pinch: “One of my favorite tricks to combat the sticky or wet look while maintaining volume is using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">R+Co Skyline Dry Shampoo Powder</a>,” he says. “It comes in an easy-to-use pump and layers beautifully on top of this sea salt spray.” If you don’t have this specific powder on hand, any <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>dry shampoo</a> will do the trick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>Straight to wavy<strong> | Size: </strong>4.2 oz<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Cranesbill, yarrow plant extract, balm mint, sage, vitamin C</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-wavy-hair-sachajuan-ocean-mist-sea-salt-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Wavy Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sachajuan Ocean Mist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sachajuan Ocean Mist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/26iCib2woCx7k5Iujc5RNdYNaKw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sachajuan-Ocean-Mist-364cb320f4884d9195723743b736a68e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This mist is made with vitamin B12, which nourishes hair and enhances natural waves.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It has a noticeably strong fragrance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sachajuan’s Ocean Mist combines the benefits of a sea salt spray and a leave-in conditioner to create bombshell beach waves.

We will note that this has a strong scent reminiscent of men’s cologne; however, the smell fades quickly and will appeal to those who like unisex fragrances.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>All<strong> | Size: </strong>5.1 oz<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Castor oil, panthenol</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-curly-hair-rizos-curls-beach-waves-texturizing-salt-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Curly Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rizos Curls Beach Waves Texturizing Salt Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rizos Curls Beach Waves Texturizing Salt Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FHK5YAE7aNaMLg21B5KlAJDSHXQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rizos-Beach-Waves-Texturizing-Salt-Spray-867a1961cad7405391024c9354ca4356.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rizos Curls</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The lightweight moisturizing formula adds volume and texture to curls.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This product doesn’t work as well on straight hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you already have curly hair and are in search of a tousled, voluminous look, New York-based celebrity hairstylist Jae-Manuel Cardenas recommends Rizos Beach Waves Texturizing Salt Spray. “It’s ultra-nourishing and contains 96 percent naturally derived ingredients,” he says. The gentle, curl-enhancing formula also includes blue agave (a natural humectant that binds hydration to hair), antioxidant-rich red algae, and prickly pear cactus, which helps strengthen strands.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“If you are going for an air-dried look and have curly or wavy hair, add this spray when hair is damp. Start light and add more as needed, but be careful not to apply too much — that’s when you get crunchy hair, no matter what spray you use,” advises Cardenas. For even more volume and texture, spritz this through your curls before drying them with a diffuser.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type: </strong>Curly<strong> | Size: </strong>6.8 oz<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Sea salt, blue agave, red algae, prickly pear cactus</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fine-hair-kevin-murphy-hair-resort-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Fine Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kevin Murphy Hair Resort Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kevin Murphy Hair Resort Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uPIfB4UqgZXkMQ73f7of81z7SXY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kevin-Murphy-Hair-Resort-Spray-09b52c8c7a804c1885df26203368bd06.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This incredibly light spray adds volume and texture without weighing down fine strands.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Its firm hold may cause some stiffness if you use too much.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Kevin Murphy is renowned for his surfer-cool hairstyles, so it’s no surprise that the stylist’s sea salt spray made our list.

Some of the most common and effective ingredients found in sea salt sprays are kelp and seaweed extract, which contain a cornucopia of vitamins and minerals that support hair’s vitality and promote growth.

It adds a layer of gritty texture and volumizes hair, giving it extra body. “Salt is osmotic — it ends up pulling water from the hair and scalp,” explains Reyman. “The fullness, volume, and grip you feel in your hair after being in the ocean (besides some sand which also adds to the texture) is due to the way salt interacts with the hair cuticle as it swells and dries.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Stylists love to use sea salt spray as a foundation for different styles because it helps hair hold its shape and reduces frizz. You can use it after styling your hair for a messy matte texture, or apply it before styling with heat tools for extra grip. “Sea salt sprays have so many applications,” says Bishop. “If you have thinner hair, you can use it for texture and lift. It’s also amazing for people with naturally curly hair, accentuating their curls while adding bounce.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is sea salt spray good for hair?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In general, sea salt spray is safe for most hair types as long as it’s used in moderation.

Be sure to spray about 10 to 12 inches away from the head so it’s not too concentrated.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Remember: Less is more when using sea salt spray.
