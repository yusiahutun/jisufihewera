Roxanne Kaiser and Antonio Mattei were two of five original couples on Season 2 of The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On. Roxanne, a 31-year-old founder and CEO, was the Ultimatum Receiver, while Antonio, a 30-year-old freight broker, was the Ultimatum Giver.</p><p>At The Choice, Roxanne and Antonio both recoupled with new partners. Roxanne recoupled with Alex Chapman, whose original partner was Kat Shelton, while Antonio recoupled with Kat. Roxanne and Antonio reunited at The Changeover. Both Roxanne and Antonio seemed to be done with their trial marriages. Antonio’s relationship with Kat never seemed to become romantic due to his feelings for Roxanne, while Roxanne ended her relationship with Alex after he lied to her parents about opening the door for her and claimed to Alex that she didn’t respect him.</p><p>So are Roxanne and Antonio still together from The Ultimatum Season 2? The answer is yes. Roxanne and Antonio were one of four couples who got engaged in The Ultimatum Season 2 finale, along with Alex and Kat; Ryann and James; and Riah and Trey. They confirmed they were still together during The Ultimatum Season 2 reunion. “Since the proposal, it’s been an adjustment. Good and bad,” Roxanne said during the reunion. Roxanne and Antonio also confirmed they were still together in an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Today</a> in August 2023 after The Ultimatum Season 2 reunion was released. “I’m still engaged. Hello, still engaged. Big, big deal for me!” Roxanne said, adding that she and Antonio hadn’t started wedding planning yet.</p><p>She continued, “Antonio opened a business a month ago. I’m still focused on my company. I’m taking baby steps towards the next phase of what happens after an engagement. I’m happy to do it. Antonio and I are growing together. I feel like we’re closer than ever, which is cool. Never thought it would happen.”</p><p>Antonio, for his part, told Today that he doubted Roxanne would accept his proposal. “I think the first words out of her mouth after I said, ‘Will you marry me?’ [were] ‘I just want you to be happy,’” he said. So I didn’t know what that meant, but I definitely thought that she was getting ready to say ‘no.’” A year after their engagement, Antonio told Today that his and Roxanne’s relationship “couldn’t be better.” “I’ve never been happier in my life. Put it that way,” Antonio said. “It’s really the happiest that I can ever remember myself being, ever. So things are good.”</p><p>Roxanne and Antonio also confirmed they were still together in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bustle</a>. “Being engaged is huge for me,” Roxanne said. “I feel a different level of commitment to someone, which is dope. I love it, it’s cool. I still am shocked to be in this place, but I’m happy to be in this place.”</p><p>Though they were in a good place, Roxanne told Bustle that she was “still working through” her reservations about getting engage to Antonio in couple’s therapy. “It’s a new place, and I think sometimes therapy or guidance can help anyone with uncertainty or new things in their life that are uncomfortable and weird,” she said. “And we do that to make sure we’re on the right path for what we want in the future for both of us. It’s a lot to take in, and the next stage now is obviously a wedding. I need Ultimatum: The Wedding because I don’t know, are we ever going to do it? I will get there. It’s just going to take a little bit of time.”</p><p>As far as their wedding, Roxanne told Bustle that she wants to “soak in being engaged,” though she has thought about a “dress that might be dope.” “Roxanne and I are finally able to explore what it’s like to not worry about finances as much and really just enjoy each other and get to know what it’s like to be in a relationship with each other where all of our needs are met,” Antonio said. “It’s been a great experience since we got back. I’ve never been more sure about something in my life. I’ve got this confidence that I haven’t had before and this feeling that I’ve made the right decision and I’m on the right path. It’s very empowering, and I’ve kind of hit a new stride. So life’s pretty good.”</p><p>Before they confirmed they were still together, Roxanne and Antonio hinted at their relationship status on their social media. Both Roxanne and Antonio still follow each other on Instagram. However, neither had liked any of each other’s recent Instagram posts. It’s believed that The Ultimatum Season 2 filmed from September 2022 to December 2022. In September 2022, Antonio shared an <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> photo of Roxanne at a restaurant opening. “Spent the weekend at my favorite rooftop @palosanto_atl— CONGRATS ON THE NEW SPOT @lalox_rivera. We’ll be back to see you soon,” he captioned the post, to which Roxanne commented, “Who is that chick [cheesing].” Though the post was shared before The Ultimatum Season 2 started filming, it seemed to be a clue that Roxanne and Antonio were still together given that he still had the photo up on his Instagram. Antonio also had several other Instagram posts still up of him and Roxanne, including a photo of them at a wedding in March 2022 and another of them on New Year’s 2022. In an <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> post announcing he was on The Ultimatum Season 2 in August 2023, Antonio referred to Roxanne as his girlfriend, which hinted that he didn’t get engaged in the finale, though that ended up being a misdirection to not spoil the season. “When you sign up for the ultimatum to propose to your girlfriend but then the talent starts walking in…. $@#%!… tune in NOW to see what happens!” he captioned the post.</p><p>Read Roxanne and Antonio’s about page on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Netflix’s site</a> ahead:</p><p>“From the moment that Antonio laid eyes on Roxanne, he knew that she was wife material. She felt a strong connection as well, but the two wouldn’t get together until years later. Once they eventually reconnected over social media, it was clear to both of them that they were meant for each other. Now they’ve been together — on and off — for the last four years and life has only gotten sweeter.”</p><p>“For Antonio, marriage is the natural next step in their relationship, but the last thing on career-focused Roxanne’s mind is planning a wedding. She first wants her forever partner to match her income and business ambition and Antonio just hasn’t met her expectations. While he admires her entrepreneurial spirit, Antonio wishes that she’d pay him more attention, particularly when it comes to demonstrating her affection. Now Antonio is giving Roxanne the ultimatum because he believes ‘that kind of pressure needs to be applied’ for her to seriously consider accepting a proposal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfp7y5rc2nnGaZnqm8r7XOZqqtoZyherW7xp6roZ2iYsGpsYyuo62hnZbBtrmO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./50-facts-about-kris-humphries.html><span>←</span><span>50 Facts about Kris Humphries</span></a>
