Shirt, pants, and watch, Willis's own. FASHION EDITOR: Joanna Hillman</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like all good Brits, Alasdhair Willis loves to talk about the weather. "I've become some-thing of an authority on wind and rain," he tells me wryly. "It makes me a fun dinner-party companion." Indeed, in his two years as creative director of the 159-year-old Scottish Wellington boot brand Hunter, Willis has, along with his intense study of rainproof fabrics and rubber, become an obsessive tracker of all things meteorological, a barometer by which he has come to measure not just the weather but the company's success. "We've had the warmest, driest spring on record this year—historically, that would not be good for a brand like this," he offers. "But we're doing really well. It's not pouring rain outside and business is still booming. That tells me we're doing something right."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I meet Willis on one of those unseasonably warm, dry spring days at Hunter's London headquarters, where his whitewashed office is almost entirely free of clutter. The 45-year-old Yorkshireman is as pristinely presented as ever, in a navy crewneck sweatshirt, beige trousers, and box-fresh Adidas. His eyes are the brightest shade of blue and, coupled with his soft northern accent, have earned him near heartthrob status in fashion circles. Willis is known for having enviably good taste, and is frequently recognized for being one of the most sartorially astute guests at his wife, designer Stella McCartney's, Paris shows (a quality emphasized when, season after season, he proudly stands to applaud her).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unlike McCartney, who honed her craft at London's prestigious Central Saint Martins college, Willis doesn't think of himself as a fashion designer—he studied fine art at the Slade School, and admits that he gets a thrill out of the geekier aspects of his job. "I love working on the really technical stuff," he says, enthusing over an image of a boot from Hunter's new high-performance Field line that he has pulled up on his iPhone. "I'm about rationalizing design. It's not minimalism but a reduction in componentry. Everything has to measure against some purpose."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's this attention to detail that Willis has drawn upon in working to transform Hunter into a global fashion force. Having collaborated with some of the world's largest brands—in addition to cofounding the glossy design magazine <i data-redactor-tag=i>Wallpaper*,</i> he started the consultancies Announcement, a creative shop with a client list that includes David Beckham and Adidas; and the Anonymous Partner, a go-to for Veuve Clicquot and Christie's—Willis was something of a dream appointment for Hunter CEO James Seuss, who got to know him while heading up McCartney's label. On Willis's watch, they've launched Hunter Original, a ready-to-wear line that scored the galoshes brand a coveted spot on London's Fashion Week schedule last year, and opened Hunter's first stand-alone shop, on Regent Street in London. (There are plans to open stores in New York and Tokyo.) The company has also made huge inroads in the U.S., where Hunter's new Original Short Fringe boot has sold well. "We're not a fashion brand in the traditional sense," explains Willis. "The people who love and wear Hunter come from many different walks of life, and always have. I am very keen to maintain that."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Nothing puts a damper on Alasdhair Willis's style. Here, the design virtuoso opens up about breathing new life into the British boot brand Hunter, talking shop with his wife, Stella McCartney, and why the forecast is looking brighter than ever—rain or shine.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In February, Willis unveiled his fall collection in an industrial space on a catwalk surrounded by waterfalls, swiftly silencing those who had once laughed at the proposition of a rain boot label mounting a runway show. "For me, the show is about creating an experience," he says. "We're not concerned with hopping on the latest trend. We have a strong personality. We know who the customer is, and we design around their world."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Conspicuously low-key, Willis and McCartney reside in leafy West London, and are more likely to be found enjoying a quiet lunch with friends or collecting one of their four kids from school than at red-carpet events and fashion parties. The pair famously fell in love after meeting for a business breakfast at Brown's Hotel, when Willis was asked to consult for McCartney's brand during its very early days. "We had the meeting, and then I called her that same day," recalls Willis. "The rest is history." They also like to escape the city regularly. A country estate in Worcester—where rose-dotted hedgerows conceal a redbrick Georgian encircled by English gardens—serves as their weekend getaway, while vacations are often spent in Scotland, where the couple married in 2003. "We try to keep our family time safe and protected," he says. "It's not always easy, especially during particularly busy times or when we both have shows coming up. But we do our best. It's a juggling act." That said, Willis, a lifelong fan of the Middlesbrough FC soccer team, isn't above taking (or wearing) his work home with him, especially at his and McCartney's kids' soccer and rugby games. "The Hunter boots and jackets come in useful for those," he adds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Do Willis and McCartney ever swap tips? "Of course, we support each other, and we talk to each other about what we're doing," he says. So they're not arguing over next season's shoe shape or trying to decide on a soundtrack for their next show as they're packing school bags and loading the dishwasher? Willis laughs. "I imagine we're like every other couple," he says. "My wife asks for my opinion, and I ask for hers, but mostly she tells me to trust my instincts. That's the best sort of advice."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Alongside Stella's famous dad, Sir Paul, Willis and McCartney's children—two boys and two girls, ages four to 10—are front-row regulars at both of their parents' shows. The kids also seem to have strong opinions when it comes to fashion. "My youngest son, who is seven, is quite inventive," says Willis. "He's always playing around with clothes. That's got to have come from Mummy and Daddy. He comes down to breakfast on a Saturday wearing a football kit and a more formal jacket. I love that."</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Hunter </strong>coats, $925-995, boots, $275, accessories, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://us.hunterboots.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=us.hunterboots.com data-vars-ga-product-id=073b5dc5-ed1a-4270-9a37-b4ef17bba47d data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=http://us.hunterboots.com/ data-product-url=http://us.hunterboots.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=http%3A%2F%2Fus.hunterboots.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=40f98a20-19eb-455b-a876-ad7b33f221d1 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">us.hunterboots.com</a>.&nbsp;Menswear, Willis's own.
