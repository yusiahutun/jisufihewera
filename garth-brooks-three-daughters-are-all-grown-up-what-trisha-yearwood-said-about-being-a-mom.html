They were eight, six, and four,"&nbsp;</strong>Garth, 61, confessed.</p><p id=exUCIa90DIY data-wc=13><strong>SEE:</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Inside Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood's jaw-dropping 300-acre mega-mansion - see photos</a></p><p id=eDGLtHijk31 data-wc=28>Fortunately, Trisha was onboard to help him navigate his parenting journey.

I never even really babysat!"</strong> she revealed to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a> magazine in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p id=eiMZRO--U57 data-wc=15>SEE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Reba McEntire's former $5m Nashville home is now a five-star resort – see inside</a></p><p id=eKhydXNUZq_ data-wc=23>Although Sandy has always been a brilliant and supportive mom to her children, Trisha, 58, would accept the role of "bonus mom" gleefully.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d5cfcb18c03e-garth-brooks-daughter-allie.jpg><p id=e2_CmSjCKJ data-wc=66><strong>"When you don’t have children, you have the luxury of being selfish, because it’s just about you.</strong> You don’t have to think about somebody else first," she explained to SheKnows. "And as an artist, it’s easy to be really egocentric because your job is to be thinking about your career, what you have to do next, how you’re going to take yourself to the next level.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekO1cPRv5S data-wc=26>"So to get out of that space and to realize that it doesn’t matter what I have going on, it was a real lesson for me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4934b5bd6dfb-garth-brooks-sandy-baby.jpg><p id=eXH1rS20_L data-wc=50>She was thankful that they accepted her into their lives too.

I didn’t know how much children brought into your life until I got a chance to be a part of their lives."</p><p id=e5QdjEcVV_ data-wc=46>Trisha relished the opportunity to become a parent and confessed: <strong>"It was a gift that I received from Garth and the girls of having them in a life</strong> that I didn’t even know I was missing, you know, and I can’t imagine my life without them."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/57f7fd966483-gettyimages-459152832.jpg><p id=ee_51Abh5Yj data-wc=54>Rather than use the term 'stepmom', Trisha has a preferred name.<strong>&nbsp;"When I think stepmom, I think Cinderella, you know, so I always prefer bonus mom,"&nbsp;</strong>she explained. "<a class=hm-link href=#>Jada Pinkett Smith</a> told me years ago, she’s like, ‘you’re a bonus mom, don’t call yourself something else.’ So I’ve taken that and run with it."</p><p id=ecuojRYsht data-wc=23>The women all have their own lives now, Taylor and August are incredibly private and few photos of them have been made public.&nbsp;</p><p id=eBVLP0V4Ua data-wc=64>However, Garth's youngest, Allie Colleen (as she is known) is following in his footsteps and carving out a career in music.
