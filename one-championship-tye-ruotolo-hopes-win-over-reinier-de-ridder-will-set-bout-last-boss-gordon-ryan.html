The two Brazilian jiu jitsu black belts, both Americans, have been linked to a bout for some time, but have yet to meet on the mats. Ruotolo, 20, is hoping that will finally soon – once he has packed on enough muscle to compete with his heavier rival.

Ruotolo, 20, is hoping that will finally soon – once he has packed on enough muscle to compete with his heavier rival.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My goal in jiu jitsu is to be the best of all time, no matter what, no matter the size of my opponent, and to do that naturally without steroids,” Ruotolo told the Post in Denver, Colorado on Monday. “It might take a little longer, getting bigger, putting on more muscle, but that’s my plan: to take Gordon out.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ruotolo is in Denver for a grappling match with ONE middleweight MMA champ and fellow BJJ black belt Reinier De Ridder – who is also expected to be the larger, stronger man in their match-up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He sees the bout with De Ridder, who has trained with Ryan, as a surmountable challenge – the reason he asked for the match-up after submitting Marat Gafurov last December. He also sees it as a good opportunity to get accustomed to fighting bigger opponents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wouldn’t have called him out if I wasn’t pretty confident in the match,” he said. “He’s got good jiu jitsu. He’s a decorated double champ in MMA.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve got an amazing strength coach with me right now, my body’s feeling the best its ever felt, and my jiu jitsu, my technique,” he added. “It’s hard to bulk and feel agile, but that’s part of my game, so we’ve keeping the balance and it’s been working really well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m excited to test what we’ve been working on with Reinier, someone a bit bigger.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/04/bd6627a0-e255-4cfd-bd4d-bc272b7f1d1c_d8cac2a8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ruotolo does not believe a win over De Ridder will be enough to set up a super fight with Ryan, who is considered one of the top grapplers on Earth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, he is hoping a victory over the Dutch MMA champion will launch him into a match with Ryan’s training partner Nicholas Meregali, a man he lost a decision to at the 2022 ADCC World Championship in Las Vegas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m going to have to meet Meregali first,” he said. “He’s kind of the one guy under Gordon that I want to take out. If I can get past Reinier, we’re going to Meregali and then Gordon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Gordon will be the last boss.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Ryan ‘felt really bad’ leaving ONE, open to grappling Ruotolos</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ryan was previously under contract with ONE, but ultimately left the promotion without partaking in a single bout under its banner.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He is now under contract with FloSports, which will create some logistical challenges for a future fight with Ruotolo, but the ONE fighter is hopeful it will still happen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think he will [accept the match],” he said. “I gave him the opportunity and he didn’t – so we’ll see. I think he’d rather sit behind the keyboard and talk a lot of s***.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When he’s ready to take the match, I’m here.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Victories over De Ridder, Meregali and Ryan are the last items on Ruotolo’s to-do list as far as submission grappling career is concerned, but that is not where his plans end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/04/9ef33a8f-ac9c-4fec-abd8-0f9ebd8ad8d8_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His hope is that, after beating his three rivals, he will be in a position to transition “straight to MMA” under the ONE banner.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s a big goal of mine, to become the best in MMA too,” he said. “That’s going to take some time. It’s a whole other life, a whole other route. I for sure want to do that in ONE.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It will be difficult for Ruotolo to achieve all of his goals in ONE – particularly as he and his brother Kade work to open their own gym in Costa Rica – but he believes he can make it all happen before the end of 2023.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I want to make this all happen this year,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mppmiqbaiuIyaqa2rX5y%2ForzPpaCnn1%2BWv7W1wqWcaGtiZoZ0fZVopqedXZi1ornPoqanq5ievW7A2J5kq62fqbytu4yhpqmdo2LEqrqMqK2eql2nsqq6yJ6pZpyVYr%2BqsMOeqWavmaG5br%2FErWSbp6Wpeq2t0q1km6ejqHqou9Gdpqdloq6urw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./12-surprising-facts-about-east-siberian-laika.html><span>←</span><span>12 Surprising Facts About East Siberian Laika</span></a>
