Unlike other apps like Photoshop, Procreate was developed specifically for the iPad.</p><p>This means easy-to-use controls, fast performance, and many gestures you can use and personalize to create the best workspace while you let&nbsp;your creativity run wild. If you want to master Procreate, here are some essential gestures you need to up your game.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=zoom-in-or-out-in-a-pinch>1. Zoom In or Out in a Pinch</h2><p>Just like you would on any picture in the Photos app, you too can pinch to zoom in or out in Procreate. This is a great tip for artists who work on drawings that have&nbsp;a lot of details.</p><p>If you want to zoom out, just <strong>pinch your fingers apart</strong> on your canvas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pinch-to-Zoom-Procreate-iPad.jpeg><p>To zoom in, all you need to do is <strong>pinch your fingers</strong> <strong>together</strong> on the screen.</p><h2 id=do-a-quick-pinch-to-fit-your-art-in-the-screen>2. Do a Quick Pinch to Fit Your Art in the Screen</h2><p>Pinching can also help you make your art fit perfectly on your screen, no matter what size your device is. But you'll have to do it faster.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>To fit your canvas on your screen, you need to&nbsp;<strong>pinch your fingers quickly together</strong> on your screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Fit-canvas-to-screen-Procreate-iPad.jpeg><p>If you decide you want to go back to where your canvas was, just&nbsp;<strong>quickly pinch your fingers apart</strong> to&nbsp;return to the original position.</p><h2 id=rotate-your-canvas>3. Rotate Your Canvas</h2><p>When drawing something, sometimes it's better to see it at different angles&nbsp;to make it easier to create other parts of your drawing. And this couldn't be easier with Procreate.</p><p>To rotate your canvas,&nbsp;<strong>put two fingers on your screen</strong> and<strong> twist your fingers</strong> in a circular motion.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Rotate-canvas-Procreate-iPad.jpeg><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>How to Install Brushes in Procreate</a></span></p><h2 id=you-can-use-two-fingers-to-undo>4. You Can Use&nbsp;Two Fingers to Undo...</h2><p>Instead of pressing the <strong>Undo</strong>&nbsp;button, you can quickly undo any mistake you made with just two fingers. Just&nbsp;<strong>tap with two fingers</strong> on your screen to undo your most recent stroke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Undo-Procreate-iPad.jpeg><p>You can also&nbsp;<strong>press and hold with two fingers</strong> to continuously undo the strokes you've made.</p><h2 id=or-use-three-fingers-to-redo>5. Or Use Three Fingers to Redo</h2><p>Just like&nbsp;undoing, if you want to redo a part of your drawing you just undid, you can do it by&nbsp;<strong>tapping your screen with three fingers</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Redo-Procreate-iPad.jpeg><p>Likewise, you can&nbsp;<strong>press and hold with three fingers</strong> to continuously redo what you've undone.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=wipe-your-layers-clean>6. Wipe Your Layers&nbsp;Clean</h2><p>Using the eraser tool to clean your canvas can be tedious. Fortunately, Procreate makes it super easy to clean layers with just one gesture.</p><p>Just&nbsp;put<strong> three fingers</strong> on your screen and move your fingers side to side as if you were&nbsp;<strong>scrubbing</strong>. Do it until you've erased all the selected layers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Erase-a-layer-Procreate-iPad.jpeg><h2 id=7-quickly-access-the-cut-copy-and-paste-menu>&nbsp;7. Quickly Access the Cut, Copy, And Paste Menu</h2><p>We've mentioned this trick in our previous guide on <a href=#>how to master Procreate</a>, but it's so cool that it's worth telling you about it again. You can quickly copy and paste items with the help of the cut, copy and paste menu that automatically appears on your screen.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>On your canvas,&nbsp;<strong>swipe down</strong> with&nbsp;<strong>three fingers</strong> on any part of your screen. A small menu with the options to <strong>Copy</strong>, <strong>Cut</strong>, <strong>Paste</strong>, <strong>Duplicate</strong>, <strong>Copy All</strong>, and <strong>Cut</strong>, and <strong>Paste</strong> will pop up on top of your canvas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Copy-Paste-Menu-Procreate-iPad.jpeg><h2 id=tap-with-four-fingers-to-go-full-screen>8. Tap With Four Fingers to Go Full Screen</h2><p>Similar to fitting your drawing on the screen with a quick pinch, you can also make your canvas go full screen, which is perfect if you&nbsp;want to&nbsp;focus only on your canvas.</p><p>To go full screen on Procreate,&nbsp;<strong>tap with four fingers</strong> on your screen. This will make the menu disappear. You should also see a full screen icon on the top right.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-screen-Procreate-iPad.jpeg><p>If you want to go back, all you have to do is<strong> tap again with four fingers</strong>.</p><h2 id=use-your-brush-as-an-eraser>9. Use Your Brush as an Eraser</h2><p>Sometimes, you might want to use the same settings you have on your brush to erase your drawing details. This can add a cool effect or shading, depending on what your settings are.</p><p>To use the same brush settings for your eraser, all you have to do is&nbsp;<strong>press and hold</strong> your eraser until you see a message that says <strong>Erase with Current Brush</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Erase-with-current-brush-Procreate-iPad.jpeg><h2 id=expand-the-color-circle>10. Expand the Color Circle</h2><p>The color circle (or color wheel) is big enough to grab&nbsp;the color you need, but you might need a clearer view of the color you're choosing.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Tap on the <strong>color circle</strong> at the top right corner. Place two fingers in the color circle and&nbsp;<strong>pinch them apart</strong>. This will make the color circle bigger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Expand-Color-circle-Procreate-iPad.jpeg><p>To bring it back to its original size,&nbsp;<strong>pinch two fingers together</strong>.</p><h2 id=quick-view-your-canvas>11. Quick View Your&nbsp;Canvas</h2><p>If you just want to view your art without risking the chance of making an accidental stroke, you can quickly&nbsp;view&nbsp;it from the Library. When you're in your Library,&nbsp;<strong>pinch two fingers apart</strong> on any canvas to expand and preview it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Quick-view-canvas-Procreate-iPad.jpeg><p>You can <strong>tap on your screen's left or right side</strong> to switch between other canvases in your Library. To go back to the Library, just&nbsp;<strong>pinch two fingers together</strong> on your screen.</p><h2 id=customize-your-own-gestures>12. Customize Your Own Gestures</h2><p>The best part about Procreate is that you can customize some gestures to your liking. You can make it so a specific gesture does what you need. This way, it&nbsp;doesn't perform&nbsp;the actions that Procreate sets by default. Here's how:</p><li>On your Canvas, tap on the&nbsp;<strong>S</strong><strong>ettings icon</strong>, which is the little wrench on the top right side of the screen.</li><li>Tap on&nbsp;<strong>Prefs</strong> >&nbsp;<strong>Gesture Controls</strong>. <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gesture-Controls-Procreate-iPad.jpeg></li><li>Choose how you want to customize your gestures and what you want them to do.</li><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>There are a lot of options available, and Procreate leaves a bunch of them toggled off for simplicity's sake. You can try and test all these options to find the best one for you.</p><h2 id=now-it-s-your-turn>Now It's Your Turn</h2><p>These gestures will make your life easier and boost your productivity on Procreate. Remember, you can always customize these gestures so they fit your needs. Now it's your turn—get out there and become the next digital Picasso!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGicrKuVo8Gqrctmp6unk6eyosDEZp6eq6Sqv6a%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./big-brother-10-jerry-macdonald-now-html.html><span>←</span><span>Where Is Jerry MacDonald Now?</span></a>
