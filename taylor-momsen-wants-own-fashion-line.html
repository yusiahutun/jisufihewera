Taylor Momsen wants her own fashion line. The singer slash actress, who was recently replaced as the spokesperson for Madonna’s clothing line Material Girl by Kelly Osbourne, would love to try designing but is currently too busy to take on any other projects. The actress said, “I’ve always wanted to have a clothing line at some point, but when I do do that I really want to have the time to be able to commit to it properly."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Right now I’m so busy, but sometime in the future I would love to have a line, absolutely. I’ll be very involved in the design and all of it, I want to spend all my time making it the best it can possibly be. I don’t want to just put my name on it and have other people do all the work.”</p><p>Momsen loves <a href=#>fashion</a>, particularly from the 60s but insists she would never try to copy anyone else’s look as she likes to be unique. The Pretty Reckless frontwoman added, “I try to be original and have my own style, there’s a certain way I love to dress. I’ve always dressed differently to all the other kids but that’s the great thing about fashion, it doesn’t have to be for everyone. It’s personal and however you look is a reflection of you. I draw inspiration from different eras – I love the 60s and I love Edie Sedgewick but I wouldn’t say I dress exactly like that. I just try to make everything my own.”</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async alt=Try_It_On_endofarticle.gif src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2011/02/try_it_on_endofarticle21.gif width=151 height=34 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br>Try on Taylor Momsen’s hairstyles in the <a href=# title="Taylor Momsen">Makeover Studio</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BmrdStsGhtaGaEcYKOrZiypJ%2Bneq67zKycp2Wnlru1v4yorqdllpbAqbXOp2SloZ6afA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shania-twain-dazzles-show-stopping-ultra-mini-dress-thigh-high-boots-queen-of-me-tour.html><span>←</span><span>Shania Twain dazzles in show-stopping ultra-mini dress and thigh-high boots for latest Queen of Me c</span></a>
