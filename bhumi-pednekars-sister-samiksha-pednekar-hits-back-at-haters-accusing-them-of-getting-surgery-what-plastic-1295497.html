However, in an old interview, the Toilet: Ek Prem Katha actress clarified that they are not twins. The actress told ETimes, “Contrary to what many think, we are not twins. We are sisters, and, according to some people, we look very similar, though we don't think so. But she is my best friend and as we are growing up, I feel our relationship is just growing thicker.</p><h3><strong>Bhumi Pednekar’s work front</strong></h3><p>Bhumi started 2024 with the crime thriller film Bhakshak.
