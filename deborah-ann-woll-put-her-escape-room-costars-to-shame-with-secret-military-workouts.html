"I looked up what the fitness training is to enter the army and I made sure I could pass that and working on it every day."</p><p>According to costar Jay Ellis, nobody knew about her "secret military workouts," but when they found out, they came to a harsh realization.</p><p>"Tyler [Labine] walked into the gym one day and Deb was in there doing a full on military boot camp, won't even address him, is just like, 'I'm in this right now,'" he explained.

While they're promised a lucrative prize, they soon learn there are also deadly consequences for accepting the challenge.</p><p>The rooms in the film are inspired by the characters' fears, including drowning, hypothermia and being burnt alive.

"So it'd probably be a middle school-themed escape room. I think I would fall to pieces!"</p><p>"Mine would be some kind of like outbreak," added Ellis. "That would freak me out. I'm not a hypochondriac, but I like to make sure I'm healthy often."</p><p>As for who they wouldn't mind getting locked up with, the "Insecure" star had the right idea. "I'm gonna go with Dwayne Johnson, The Rock," he explained. Not only could the actor keep things light with a joke or two, if worst comes to worst, he "could bust through a wall" to get them outta there.</p><p>Check the video above to see Woll's ideal celebrity partner and what it was like for the stars to film on an upside-down set.</p><p>"Escape Room" hits theaters January 4.</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/17/o/2018/11/30/17e6c8ef702656409983a12446224ed3_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Netflix</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnp7j2pmaWpfmbKju9Gan2aZnqN6uLvLpWSpraRitaa%2BjJ6qnJmgmnqzu86mZJyno6mus7%2BMraZmq5iWuqZ51qKroWWjmrCzsdNmpKKkmamus8WMsKaro5%2BqwbR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./309280-10-cute-diane-keaton-hairstyles-html.html><span>←</span><span>10 cute Diane Keaton hairstyles in 2020</span></a>
