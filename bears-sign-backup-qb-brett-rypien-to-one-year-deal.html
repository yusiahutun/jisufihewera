On Wednesday, they went the backup route and signed Brett Rypien to a one-year deal. Chicago is believed to be eyeing Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in April's draft. The Bears are also expected to trade Justin Fields, who started 38 games over the past three years. Rypien, 27, will likely compete with Tyson Bagent for the No. 2 job. Rypien has made four NFL starts since entering the league as an undrafted free agent in 2019 with the Denver Broncos. He has passed for 950 yards, four touchdowns and nine interceptions in 10 games. Last season, Rypien started for the Rams in a 20-3 loss to the Green Bay Packers in Week 9. He was 13 of 28 for 130 yards and one interception and was released two days later. He had brief stints with the Seattle Seahawks and New York Jets later in the season. Rypien played college football at Boise State and holds the Mountain West career passing yardage record of 13,578. He is the nephew of Mark Rypien, who played 11 NFL seasons (1988-97, 2001) for five teams and was MVP of Super Bowl XXVI for Washington. --Field Level Media</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKugpL%2B1v46nmK2hn6OurXvBnpirq12otqi6jJuYnKOlpXqyroybqZ6spGK%2FurzInqVmrJ9ivK%2BxjLKcmqpdmbKiuI6aqa2hk6GyoLDEn2txnWJmeqWDwG1kbmqTbHqjgsFxZHCZaW6Deq6YcWqca16dwa64</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-jon-bon-jovis-wife-and-high-school-sweetheart-dorothea-hurley-and-why-didnt-she-go-his-docu.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Jon Bon Jovis wife and high school sweetheart, Dorothea Hurley and why didnt she go</span></a>
