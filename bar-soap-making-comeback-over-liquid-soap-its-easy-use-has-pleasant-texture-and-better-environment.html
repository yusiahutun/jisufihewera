They are also portable and long-lasting, making them better investments all around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/15/2bd46387-9a9e-4920-85bc-d4253c53889d_80084412.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Less is more</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bar soaps align with minimalist beauty practices by providing a simple yet effective approach to skincare.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As a single and multipurpose product, bar soap reduces the need for a range of speciality items (face washes, body washes and hand soaps), promoting a streamlined routine,” Roberts says. Their compact and eco-friendly packaging also resonates with minimalist values, reducing waste compared to liquid alternatives.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Would you wash with snail slime soap?
