class=mol-para-with-font><span>In court documents seen by Daily Mail Online, Sharpe Gretz described how Gliniewicz invited her to a hotel in February 2000 to give her a military uniform he had purchased for her son.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Once there he 'directed her to his hotel room where he gave her a box of chocolates for Valentine's Day.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Gliniewicz proceeded to rub her shoulders before pressuring Sharpe Gretz into performing oral sex, according to the complaint filed three years later.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The 'sexual favors' continued for months despite Sharpe Gretz pleading with Gliniewicz, by then a respected sergeant and her commanding officer, that she wanted it to stop.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Gliniewicz continued during this time to indicate to Petitioner that these sexual favors were strongly encouraged and/or required to protect her job,' the suit alleged.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Gliniewicz also indicated that he would help her become an officer in charge in return for these sexual favors.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'In fact, on or about April, 2000, Gliniewicz indicated in a written report that Petitioner was developing the skills necessary to become an officer in charge'.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The complaint stated that Gliniewicz would ask Sharpe Gretz to meet him behind a business and he would 'often be urinating' when she arrived.</span></p><h3 class=wocc><b>HOW HE USED THE EXPLORERS</b></h3><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Police have suggested Gliniewicz&nbsp;used his experience staging crime scenes in the Explorers program to set up his own in a bid to convince officers it was a homicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Officers say Gliniewicz took a 'five-figure sum' from the Explorers program over seven years, spending the money on loans, holidays, gym membership and porn.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Police say that before Gliniewicz shot himself he laid out his baton, pepper spray and personal glasses to mislead officers and make it look like there was an altercation.</span><span class=mol-style-bold>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>He then 'strategically aimed' two gunshots so that it hit his cell phone and bulletproof vest.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'One comment Gliniewicz would make when Petitioner found him was that he could have used her help,' it said.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Sharpe Gretz resigned from the Explorers program but said her former supervisor harassed her and bullied her into performing oral sex on one further occasion in a conference room in October 2000.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She reported Gliniewicz to the then-Chief of Police, Edward Gerretson, who suspended Gliniewicz for 30 days and ordered him to attend sexual addiction counseling, according to the suit.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>However she subsequently accused the department of sexual discrimination because she was 'berated for being a whiner' and victimized over minor mistakes such as forgetting her gun.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The female officer quit the Village of Fox Police Department in August 2001 before launching an action for wages lost, emotional damages and punitive damages.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The complaint was eventually dismissed because Sharpe Gretz repeatedly failed to meet discovery deadlines.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>However the Village of Fox Lake did not specifically rebuff her allegations, arguing instead that she did not suffer any 'tangible, adverse employment action as a result of the alleged hostile environment.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Sharpe Gretz, who now lives in Somerset, Kentucky, did not respond to a request for comment on what police have described as Gliniewicz's 'carefully staged suicide'.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>However she did take to Facebook to discuss a news clipping about his demise, writing: 'When your put
