Many celebrate by feasting on Kentucky Fried Chicken, thanks to a wildly successful marketing campaign in the 1970s. Instead of the traditional turkey, families reserve their KFC meals weeks in advance. Another popular tradition is sharing Christmas cakes, which are typically sponge cakes decorated with strawberries and whipped cream.QIs gift-giving a big part of Christmas in Japan?AYes and no. While exchanging gifts is common, it's usually more about the thought than the value of the present.

The focus is more on spending time together and enjoying the holiday season.QWhat's unique about Christmas decorations in Japan?ACities across Japan light up with dazzling illuminations, making for a magical winter atmosphere. Tokyo, in particular, is famous for its spectacular light displays. You won't see as many Christmas trees, but when you do, they're often beautifully decorated in public spaces and shopping malls. Another unique decoration is the Christmas cake, which, while edible, is a central part of the holiday's decor.QDo Japanese people have Christmas trees?AWhile not as common in individual homes, Christmas trees are definitely part of the celebration in Japan.

Known as Santa Kurohsu or simply Santa-san, the Japanese version of Santa Claus is just as jolly and generous.

Kids look forward to Santa-san's visit, much like their counterparts in other countries.QHow do couples in Japan celebrate Christmas?AFor many young couples in Japan, Christmas Eve is considered a romantic holiday, akin to Valentine's Day in the West.
