"I feel really very fortunate to be on a show like that where everyone is wanting to be friends with each other and wanting to make connections."</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She won't discuss her personal life.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Australia's Daily Telegraph tried to pry about Brown's rumored romance with Hemsworth, the actress swiftly shut down the attempt. "I’m not answering that question," she told the outlet, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a30106412/maddison-brown-liam-hemsworth-dating-question-response/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=ELLE class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">ELLE</a>. "My rule is not talking about my personal life."</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She co-starred with Nicole Kidman in her first film role.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Brown made her film debut in 2015's Strangerland as Nicole Kidman's onscreen teenage daughter. "Nicole is someone who wants to nurture and support young actors and it was such a relief to be able to connect with her in a real way," the up-and-comer told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://wwd.com/eye/people/maddison-brown-nicole-kidman-costar-and-miu-miu-campaign-girl-10181139/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=WWD class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">WWD</a> in 2015.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Big Little Lies star even helped Brown come to a decision about her career. "I was sort of at a crossroads: I wanted to pursue acting 100 percent but still felt ties to the modeling industry. I still do," she added to WWD. "So she said to me, 'You should keep doing this. You’re good at it.' Which was, obviously, really encouraging."</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She also writes scripts and hopes to direct.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I have a bunch of scripts that I’ve been writing, that I want to bring out at the right time," Brown told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/7x798a/australian-miu-miu-model-maddison-brown-is-ready-for-hollywood data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=i-D class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">i-D</a> in 2018.

"Nicole is someone that I totally look up to and especially now, because she’s producing and putting stories about women on screen. She couldn’t have been a nicer person to work with." i-D added that Brown also looks up to Margot Robbie, who co-owns the production company LuckyChap with her husband, Tom Ackerley.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She's modeled for high-fashion designers.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Brown appeared in Miu Miu's Fall/Winter 2015 campaign, shot by Steven Meisel. She told WWD that working with the renowned photographer was "one of my ultimate career goals." She also walked runways for brands including Calvin Klein, Jason Wu, and Phillip Lim, according to i-D.</p><img alt="Face, Fashion, Beauty, Hairstyle, Lip, Eye, Street fashion, Cool, Photography, Fashion design, " title="Face, Fashion, Beauty, Hairstyle, Lip, Eye, Street fashion, Cool, Photography, Fashion design, " width=2880 height=1560 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2019-10-11-at-9-13-51-am-1570799694.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Miu Miu / YouTube</span></p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She started her career young, which meant missing out on some adolescent milestones.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Since I was about five, my whole life has been my career," Brown explained to i-D. "Yes, I was traveling the world but I missed out on lots of rites of passage such as going to a formal and having a boyfriend when I was young."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It paid off in the end, though. "I feel very grateful that I got into acting young," she added. "But now that I’ve caught up on some of those things, I think my acting gets better. You have more perspective and depth to put into every role."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
