searching for 'blood and blow' after guzzling cocaine dropped from a smuggler's plane.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It has a budget of around $30 million, with the drug-fueled bear being brought to life through CGI.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There are dozens of bloody scenes, with Banks telling Variety 'the gore is part of the fun of the ride.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the true story that inspired the movie is said to be far less dramatic after medical examiners said it is likely the bear only consumed a very small quantity of the drug.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The bear sourced the drug from a duffel bag, believed to be a 300-pound shipment of Colombian cocaine, that had been dropped out of a plane across eastern Tennessee and northern Georgia, authorities said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Convicted drug smuggler, Andrew Carter Thornton II, was linked to the shipment after his body was found on a driveway in Knoxville, Tennessee on September 11, 1985, with 77 pounds of cocaine strapped to his waist.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The real-life bear was found dead three months later, lying beside an empty bag and 40 opened bags of blow, with a medical examiner ruling he suffered from cerebral hemorrhaging, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, renal failure, heart failure and a stroke.</p><img id=i-52a5ab9cdd0910fa
