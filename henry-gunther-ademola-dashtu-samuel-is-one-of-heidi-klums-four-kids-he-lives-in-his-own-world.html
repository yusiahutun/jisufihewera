She is most famous for her work on “America’s Got Talent.”&nbsp;</p><p>The former couple married in 2005 and spent several years together before calling it quits in 2014. Aside from Henry, the couple shares two other kids, Johan and Lou.&nbsp;</p><p>Klum is also the mother to Leni Olumi from her previous relationship. Leni is the eldest of the TV host’s four kids and stepsister to Henry Gunther Ademola Dashtu Samuel.</p><p>Due to Klum’s strictness, not much is known about <a href=#>Henry</a> and his life besides what she allows to make the news. However, fans know Henry was born on September 12, 2005, and has an incredible fashion sense.&nbsp;</p><p>After his birth in 2005, Klum confessed that everyone who had seen Henry commented on how much he looked like his father, Seal.&nbsp;The resemblance between father and son has not diminished over the years.</p><p>In December 2020, Klum <a href=#>revealed</a> that Henry and his siblings were homeschooled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She praised them for being very dedicated to their studies even though adjusting to homeschooling was difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>The handsome boy and all his siblings are pretty close and inherited their mother’s fashion sense.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Henry_Gunther_Ademola_Dashtu_Samuel_Has_an_Incredible_Fashion_Sense></span>Henry Gunther Ademola Dashtu Samuel Has an Incredible Fashion Sense<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Henry was born to two incredibly talented entertainment icons. Thus, it is not surprising that he seems to have inherited their taste for aesthetics.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Henr.jpg><p>As a child, Henry always dressed impeccably, as he had a <a href=#>wardrobe</a> filled with fashionable items. Some include an Eliza Gran shirt worth $32, City Threads oversized guitar T-shirt worth $31, an Ed Hardy bee jacket worth $90, Birkenstock Jawa Camo sandals, and an Ed Hardy flock Tee.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2008, three years after he was born, Klum revealed that her children had a great costume closet where they enjoyed dressing up. The doting mother admitted then that Henry was comfortable trying on different costumes, including his sister’s princess dresses.&nbsp;</p><p>Klum did not see anything wrong with her son wanting to try out female costumes. She even seemed to have preferred them compared to his “Buzz Lightyear” costumes.&nbsp;</p><p>During an interview in 2011, the talented TV host spoke about her son’s unique style. She <a href=#>said</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>“He lives in his own world. We went to dinner all dressed properly [and Henry wore dinosaur slippers]. You can barely walk in those things, but for him, it’s not weird at all.”</p><p>Henry’s behavior is hardly shocking; for the most part, Klum supports it. After all, in their home, the number one rule everyone has to obey is always to look fantastic and fashionable.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Heidi_Klum_Is_a_Helicopter_Parent></span>Heidi Klum Is a Helicopter Parent<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Henry is one of those celebrity kids with <a href=#>extremely protective mothers</a>. Since his mother is a famous TV personality, and most of her public life is out there for all to see, she takes great care to keep her family private.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Heidi.jpg><p>The devoted mother cares a lot about her kids and has gone to great lengths to protect them from the public’s scrutinizing eyes. She rarely shares posts about them on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>When she does post pictures of her children, their facial profiles are hidden as much as possible. Her oldest child has been granted leave to use social media, but Henry and his younger siblings are not on any social network.</p><p>Klum once <a href=#>confessed</a> to being a helicopter parent who would be happiest if time could slow down so her kids wouldn’t have to age so quickly.&nbsp;Aside from not letting them post on social media, Klum also limits their time in front of the TV.</p><p>This has to do with her old-fashioned spirit, which dictates that kids need to be outside doing physical things instead of consuming content all day on TV.&nbsp;Henry Gunther Ademola Dashtu Samuel’s mom’s hovering has lessened as he and his siblings grow older.</p><p>But Klum will always be cautious and concerned about her children’s well-being, and their ages won’t change that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktaa60bJkoK2eqbWmvoyam56ln6GubrDArJ%2BtrV2orq7BxKVkoqtdpLumec6fZKGdmZm2brfLrqSsZZakwrN5yqKbrGWYmnqttdWeqmahnmK1qr%2BMqK6nZaekv62wjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jd-mccrary-lion-king-young-simba-minor-contract.html><span>←</span><span> JD McCrary Made Bank for 'Lion King' Reboot</span></a>
