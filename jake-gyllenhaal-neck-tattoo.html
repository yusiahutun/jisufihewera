Dalton is barely scraping by on the reputation that still precedes him when he is spotted by Frankie (Jessica Williams), owner of a roadhouse in the Florida Keys. She hires him to be her new bouncer in hopes of stopping a violent gang, working for crime boss Brandt (Billy Magnussen), from destroying her beloved bar. Even five to one, Brandt’s crew is no match for Dalton’s skills. But the stakes get higher with the arrival of ruthless gun-for-hire, Knox (Conor McGregor). As the brutal brawls and bloodshed escalate, the tropical Keys prove more dangerous than anything Dalton ever faced in the Octagon.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/donniedarkoastro.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/jake-gyllenhaal-taylor-swift.png><p>From the stunning visuals, stunt coordination right down to the makeup, Road House is a thrill that needs to be experienced.

I knew Patrick—we did this film&nbsp;Donnie Darko&nbsp;together, and he was always so kind to me,” he told Decider. “I just wanted to honor him and bring him with me. So I have a couple of different tattoos [in the movie] in honor of Patrick. When I put them on in the morning, I’d be reminded of the history of this piece and the origins of it, which was good to remember every day.”</p><p>However, he’s keeping mum about which tattoos are the tribute. “The only reason why I can’t is because they’re supposed to be, like, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/argylle-taylor-swift-easter-eggs/>Easter eggs</a>. They’re like, ‘Oh, don’t say! Go look for them.’ Press pause and look, you’ll find them. They’re just they’re just a little ode to him.”</p><p><strong>Road House is now available to stream on Prime Video.
