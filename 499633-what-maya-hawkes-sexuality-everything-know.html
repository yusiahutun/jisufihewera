But what is Maya's sexuality? Here are some quick facts.</p><h3>1. There's a lot of interest in Maya Hawke’s sexuality</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/27622930b875ad22.png><p class=align-left>Even before answering Maya Hawke’s sexuality in real life, it is worth exploring why her fans are more interested in her sexuality in the first place. Generally, Maya Hawke debuted as an actress in 2017, portraying a character called Jo March in the BBC adaptation of <i>Little Women</i>. Jo March’s sexuality in the series always raised questions among fans.</p><p class=align-left>Jo March’s sexuality is not explicitly mentioned or explored in <i>Little Women</i>. However, people speculated that Jo was a les*bian or bise*xual. Many argue that Jo's close relationship with her best friend, Laurie, could be interpreted as romantic or sexual. Jo's independent and quirky personality could also be seen as not adhering to traditional heterosexual norms.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/88345149c23cdfe3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Dominic Chianese? Sexuality, net worth, and children</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But Jo’s character is often referred to as a tomboy, referring to a girl who behaves in a typically boyish manner. Also, Jo is known for being outspoken, independent, and unconventional, which were not typical qualities of young women in the 19th century. Jo also rejects traditional gender roles and societal expectations.</p><p class=align-left>After her role as Jo March in <i>Little Women</i> (2017), Maya Hawke took on the role of Robin Buckley in the third season of the <a href=#>Netflix series</a> <i>Stranger Things.</i> Initially, the character's sexuality was not in the script but was added to the storyline. Robin's gender in <i>Stranger Things</i> is female. She is an intelligent and witty character who forms a close bond with Steve throughout the season.</p><p class=align-left>In episode 7, while the two of them are drugged and being interrogated by the Russians, Robin reveals her true feelings to Steve. Robin tells Steve that she used to be obsessed with him because she thought he was so full of himself that he could not see that everyone in their class thought he was a joke. But it is also revealed that Robin is attracted to women and shares that she has been obsessed with Steve's classmate, Tammy Thompson, for years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5cf8a60ee96f80d2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Adam F Goldberg relationship with Sara Goldberg, marriage, and children</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Robin's revelation of being attracted to women is portrayed as a normal part of her character.

Maya Hawke’s sexuality is queer</h3><p class=align-left>Is Robin from Stranger Things bi in real life? Maya Hawke has not explicitly identified her sexuality but has been open about her attraction to people of different genders.

It can refer to anyone not straight, whether they identify as gay, les*bian, bise*xual, pansexual, asexual, or any other non-heterosexual orientation.</p><p class=align-left>Also, in another interview in November 2022, she said she is fluid regarding her attractions. While she played a les*bian character in the <a href=#>TV show</a> <i>Stranger Things</i>, it has been confirmed that Hawke is not a les*bian in real life.
