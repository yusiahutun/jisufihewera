At the beginning of season 11, Daphne announces her pregnancy. During Daphne's pregnancy they briefly discuss David's personality, mentioning that he thrashes when he hears classical music and eagerly moves around at the mention of a pub. However, we never got to see what David would actually turn out to be in the original series, as he was only born in the series finale at a veterinary clinic.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Who plays David Crane on the Frasier reboot?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-text css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">David Crane is the nephew of Frasier Crane and a cousin to Freddy, who both now live in Boston. David is a freshman at Harvard University, where Frasier recently began working. The character is portrayed by Anders Keith, a relative newcomer to the acting world. Keith recently graduated from Juilliard in 2022, and this will be his first major on-screen role.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"David definitely inherited his father's clumsiness and neuroses, but he also has his mother's heart," Keith revealed in a behind-the-scenes interview.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">New episodes of Frasier continue to drop weekly on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.paramountplus.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Paramount+ data-vars-ga-product-id=c404e559-fdc7-4077-aedb-07dc266eb03d data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.paramountplus.com/ data-product-url=https://www.paramountplus.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525072&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$1.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=ae11b9a7-11f8-42ea-9ddd-c166cf777911 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Europe class="body-link product-links css-a3mbhf ebsw2pb0">Paramount+</a>, culminating in a 10 episode season.
