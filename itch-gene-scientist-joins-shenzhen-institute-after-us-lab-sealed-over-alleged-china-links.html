Chen, a graduate in virology from China’s Wuhan University, had lived in the US since 1990 – first as a doctoral student and then as a researcher and academic.
He earned a PhD in mouse genetics from the University of Texas followed by postdoctoral training at Caltech, before joining the Washington University School of Medicine’s anaesthesiology department as an assistant professor in 2000."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

For instance, they reported that itch was contagious – the brain cells of mice would be activated when they saw other mice scratch, making them start scratching as well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the Shenzhen lab announcement did not mention the circumstances of its latest recruitment, Chen’s return is seen as a direct result of his lab at the study centre being shut down and his group dismissed after investigations under the China Initiative.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The policy, launched during the administration of then US president Donald Trump, aimed to curb alleged theft of US intellectual property.
