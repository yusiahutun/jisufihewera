Here are five other surprising details about the “Insecure” actress you would love.</strong></p><p>Issa Rae has established herself as an entertainment giant through her outstanding acting career. Through her appearances in projects like “Insecure” and “Little,” she has become one of the most influential people in the world.</p><p>What’s more outstanding is that this talented beauty carved out her own path in the industry, making her stand tall among her counterparts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220930_122419-1024x769.jpg><p>Looking at <a href=#>Issa Rae</a>’s delicate figure, one can hardly attribute such greatness to her at first glance. But her impressive height has somehow contributed to landing her path in the movie industry. Exactly how tall is Issa Rae and what else is known about this iconic beauty?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Tall_Is_Issa_Rae></span><strong>How Tall Is Issa Rae?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Issa Rae stands at 5 feet, 9 inches tall, or 175 cm, which is an impressive <a href=#>height</a> for a woman. She weighs approximately 63 kg, a weight that complements her tall frame.</p><p>Notably, the actress works hard to maintain her tall and slim frame, keeping fit through a healthy diet and exercise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Issa_Raes_Net_Worth></span><strong>What Is Issa Rae’s Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Issa Rae has a net worth of $8 million, accumulated throughout her career, per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. The Los Angeles-born star has explored various facets of showbiz since her rise to fame, from acting and comedy, to film production and directing.</p><p>She also has writing credits in some of her movies, including “Insecure,” which she co-wrote, and “The Choir.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Some of her notable acting credits include “The Hate You Gave,” “The Photograph,” The Lovebirds,” and “Little.” Additionally, she produced “The Lovebirds,” “Rap Sh!t,” and The Photograph,” among other projects.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Issa_Raes_Real_Name></span><strong>What Is Issa Rae’s Real Name?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although the name Issa Rae has come to stay, the moniker isn’t the actress’ real name, but simply a stage name. She came into the world on January 12, 1985, in Los Angeles to parents Abdoulaye Diop and Delyna Diop.</p><p>At birth, she was given the <a href=#>name</a> Jo-Issa “Issa” Rae Diop. Her parents coined her first name, Jo-Issa, name from the moniker of her two grandmothers, Joyce and Isseu, while her middle name, Rae was chosen after an aunt, who made a living as an artist.</p><p>Who would have thought the star would follow in her aunt’s footsteps years later, after graduating from Stanford University?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220930_122409.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Issa_Rae_Want_To_Have_Kids></span><strong>Does Issa Rae Want To Have Kids?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite seemingly having no interest in marriage or kids for years, Issa Rae finally <a href=#>tied the knot</a> with partner Louis Diame in 2021.</p><p>Having crossed one milestone, the question of whether she changed her mind about kids remains. Notably, children may not be in the picture for the actress just yet, as she intends to hold it off as long as she could. The actress once <a href=#>divulged</a>:</p><p><strong>“I want to do as much as I can while I still can. I know it’s not the proper mentality to think that kids would slow you down, but I do feel that way. I like my life, I like this selfishness. And I know that I have a window.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=She_Rose_To_Fame_On_Her_Own_Terms></span><strong>She Rose To Fame On Her Own Terms</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Issa Rae rose to fame in the early 10s, following the premiere of her web series, “The MisAdventures of Awkward Black Girl,” on YouTube. The series starred Rae as the lead character, J, spotlighting her uncomfortable interactions with her co-workers and love interests.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CiA8z-mhVOf/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=</p></figure><p>Through word of mouth and blog posts, the web series went viral, snagged her major collaborations, and eventually inspired the infamous HBO pilot, “Insecure.” The 37-year-old has been unstoppable ever since.</p><p>Interestingly, with her newfound fame and fortune came new struggles, as the star found herself gaining “money weight.”</p><p>After receiving her <a href=#>wake-up call</a>, she resolved to adopt a healthier lifestyle by embracing workout routines like running. She also sticks to a healthy diet. Her fitness regimen is exactly how Issa Rae has managed to maintain her tall and slim physique in the last decade.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktbDDjK2YpaRdnsButdKsmGaqkZp6dnnSrqmpqpmotq%2BzjJ%2BYnKyjYq6kwNGeqqxlYmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bette-midler-movies.html><span>←</span><span>Bette Midler Movies: 50 Years of Funny</span></a>
