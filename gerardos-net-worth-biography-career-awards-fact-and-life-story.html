Gerardo gained his net worth through a successful career in the entertainment industry. Born Gerardo Mejía on April 16, 1965, in Guayaquil, Ecuador, he came to prominence in the early 90s with his hit song “Rico Suave”.</p><p>Little Gerardo was only twelve years old when he and his family moved to Glendale, California, the place where his music career came to life. He first entered showbiz as “Ricky” in the 1987 dramedy Can’t Buy Me Love before starting his career in music. His subsequent role was playing the character “Bird” in the 1988 crime drama Colors, where he first flaunted his dance skills even though he didn’t sing at any point in the film. It was in 1991, when he released his debut album Mo’ Ritmo that spawned his breakthrough single “Rico Sauve”. This song, which include verses with lines in both English and Spanish, like most of his other works, has made Gerardo known as a one-hit wonder via media sources including MTV and VH1. Subsequently, Gerardo became the head of A&R at Interscope’s Dance division, an American record label, and Gerardo was instrumental in signing new artists such as Enrique Iglesias and Bubba Sparxxx. At the beginning of the new millennium, he got back to the studio to record his fifth album Fame, Sex Y Dinero, which was released in October of 2001. His latest studio album is 2004’s 180°, but since his album release he has been focusing most of his career behind the scenes in the music industry and has also become a youth pastor. He is the star of the reality television series, Suave Says, on VH1 that follows him, his wife, his two daughters, his son, and his mother through their day to day lives while they work to build and strengthen their relationships.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BVp66zsM6sZKedpGLEsL7ToWSboZ%2Bcv6K8x7JknJmimrKzecCwmKuco2Kzoq%2FTZpinnF2htqexjKyrqKqpZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cheers-maddy-brum-19-hit-car-crossing-street-shares-update-hospital-html.html><span>←</span><span>Cheer's Maddy Brum, 19, is HIT by a car while crossing a street as she shares update from hospital</span></a>
