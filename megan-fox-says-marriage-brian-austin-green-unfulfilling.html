Appearing on the March 20 episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast, the actor explained why her first major relationship was, in some ways, a big mistake. “I got myself into a relationship, which I of course found—no shade to Brian, unfulfilling—because inevitably, that’s what I was going to do, because I was reenacting what I watched my mother do as a child,” Fox said."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

And I thought for a minute when I got divorced that that’s what I was gonna do, and I was single for, like, three weeks.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then she found Kelly (born Colson Baker).
