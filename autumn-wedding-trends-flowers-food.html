Celia suggested: "Why not use fruit and vegetables to create interesting table décor using figs, apples, pears, pomegranates, pumpkins and grapes which double up as décor and a further grazing option."</p><p id=eqgz30RxxqkB data-wc=43>To add a personal touch, she said brides and grooms should "ask each guest to bring their own carved out pumpkin, which you can scatter, around the venue" for "mystical lighting." Alternatively, they can be filled with flowers for table and aisle decorations.&nbsp;</p><p id=esK9ROEj7cn_ data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Why DIY wedding decor isn't the best way to save money – expert" class=hm-link href=#>Why DIY wedding decor isn't the best way to save money – expert</a></strong></p><p id=ejVSIIT-xiVA data-wc=24><strong>Planning your wedding?
