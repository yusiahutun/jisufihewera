But many people struggled with understanding the intention behind the posts and wrote back in earnest, with real “wars of words” ensuing, Fahlman said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From there, people started discussing the possibility of marking their jokes as such, in a debate that wasn’t serious at first either. But on September 19, 1982, Fahlman posted his suggestion, which would have implications so far-reaching he could have hardly foreseen it at the time: combining a colon, minus sign and bracket to depict a smiley face to indicate that something is meant humorously.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The researcher later said he had only intended the idea as temporary amusement for other users, but it soon took off and began spreading beyond the university, fuelled by the onset of the internet.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">World Emoji Day: where the word ‘emoji’ originates from</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, emojis are not only used to indicate how a statement is to be understood, but are also increasingly replacing punctuation marks, says Linz. When a little icon is used instead of a period at the end of a sentence, for example, its meaning becomes “expressive”, according to the linguist.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Emojis also help to economise communication, with a thumbs-up symbol often used to quickly signal agreement, for example.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Conversely, the lack of emojis in a message has also taken on significance, as that is often used to convey a more serious tone. Many people have developed a sense for when to use emojis – and when it’s better to leave them out, says Linz.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why live-streaming is becoming ‘the new social language’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Students of hers recently analysed the use of emojis by celebrities on Instagram, finding that actors and actresses tend to use them more often than politicians, for example.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, Linz believes that the little icons will increasingly be used in formal communication in the long term as well. “The triumph of emojis is unstoppable,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet that won’t ever completely eliminate the risk of misunderstandings, the researcher says, as the meaning of an emoji can sometimes be ambiguous and people tend to use them in different contexts with different meanings implied.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From that point of view, maybe it was the simplicity of Fahlman’s original idea that helped the concept take off.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR9mGtucG9faX1uxcSaqaxllaK8q7XSZp%2Bor12ZtqV506GcsmWjqa6zwIyapZ1lp52utXnDqJysZZaqwba%2BxGafqKSU</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-foods-shouldnt-be-eaten-together-according-traditional-chinese-medicine-it-depends-your-body.html><span>←</span><span>What foods shouldnt be eaten together according to traditional Chinese medicine?
