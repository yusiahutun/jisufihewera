The traditional-leaning country ballad is written from the perspective of a man who is trying to move on from a past relationship, but he's in denial about the feelings he still has for his former flame.</p><p>"Guess I forgot again for a second there / That I don't care," Shelton sings in the tag line.</p><p>"Back in the day I wanted this song to be a single so bad I put it on 2 different albums," Shelton writes to accompany the video clip. "We never got to it and I still regret it. Thought I’d dig it out for y'all. It’s called 'I Don’t Care.'"</p><p>Casey Beathard and Dean Dillon co-wrote "I Don't Care," which first appeared on Shelton's Pure BS album in 2007. The country superstar also included the track on his following album, Startin' Fires, in 2008, but it has remained mostly unknown to all but his biggest fans.</p><p>Shelton's current single is "Come Back as a Country Boy," from his most recent album, Body Language.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top Blake Shelton Songs: His Greatest Hits + Best Deep Cuts</h2>Taste of Country staff opinion, and the commercial success of tracks from Shelton's 12 studio albums were certainly considered in making this list of the top <a href=#>Blake Shelton</a> songs.
