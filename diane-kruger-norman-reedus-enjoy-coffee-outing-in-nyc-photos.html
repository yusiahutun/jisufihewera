The longtime lovebirds were spotted walking arm in arm as they stepped out in the West Village neighborhood of New York City.</p><p>Diane, 43, and Norman, 51, spent some quality time together as they hit the streets for a fun-filled coffee date. The National Treasure&nbsp;actress and the&nbsp;Walking Dead&nbsp;actor — who are the proud parents of their 1-year-old <a href=#>baby daughter</a> — were photographed as they took a stroll around the Big Apple.</p><p>For their outing, Diane donned an asymmetrical, floor-length skirt, a white sweater and a black puffer jacket. The Inglorious Bastards&nbsp;star accessorized her look with a pair of black leather boots and a matching hat. Diane also sported a makeup-free look!</p><p>Norman, on the other hand, looked like a total hunk as he stepped out wearing a black sweatshirt, matching vest, khaki pants and boots. The Boondock Saints&nbsp;star tried to conceal his identity as he flipped his sweatshirt up over his head and shielded his eyes behind a pair of sunglasses.</p><p>Diane and Norman’s outing comes weeks after the blonde beauty <a href=#>celebrated her man’s 51st birthday</a>. The doting mom of one — who <a href=#>secretly welcomed her and Norman’s daughter</a> in November 2018 — took to Instagram to wish the proud dad a special celebration.</p><p>“My teenage dream of a man right here!” she wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> alongside a photo of the birthday boy. “HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the love of my life.”</p><p>Although the Hollywood couple is quick to share sweet pics of each other, Norman and Diane have yet to dish any details regarding their beautiful baby girl — including her name and even a photo. Luckily for fans, the&nbsp;In the Fade&nbsp;actress gave a glimpse inside her journey through motherhood as she previously <a href=#>shared a Thanksgiving tribute for their little girl</a>.</p><p>“I know you won’t remember these walks and you won’t remember these ‘talks,’ but I hope that you’ll always remember how much you’re loved and how thankful we are to have you in our lives little one and how grateful I’ll always be to @bigbaldhead to have given me such a wonderful gift and to walk with me hand in hand,” she gushed in <a href=#>the November 2019 post</a>. “From my family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see pics from Diane and Norman’s outing!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46doJqmlWK4s8HGnqlmpp%2BnuqK6jKucnpylqHqmusmosGabn5uzprGMqKytoZ6ceqq6jKewnGWgnby1u9Jo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aaron-rodgers-injury.html><span>←</span><span>Achilles Tear Recovery Time, How Long Will He Be Out?</span></a>
