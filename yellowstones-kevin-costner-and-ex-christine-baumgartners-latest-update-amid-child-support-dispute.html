Anderle provided a detailed explanation of his decision-making process, aiming for transparency and understanding.</p><p id=eRYClhhQpAw data-wc=33>The two-day emotionally charged hearing, held in Santa Barbara, witnessed both Kevin, 68, and Christine, 49, taking the stand to discuss the future of their children and the impending challenges of their separation.</p><p id=ek3m2aXv4gy data-wc=52>At the conclusion of the hearings, the court ordered Kevin to pay a monthly child support of $63,209 to Christine. This amount starkly contrasts with the $161,592 that Christine had originally requested. The couple, who tied the knot in 2004, are parents to three teenagers: Cayden, 16; Hayes, 14; and Grace, 13.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a49229cbdc65-gettyimages-1165645431.jpg><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Kevin Costner's ex Christine Baumgartner claims she'll need to return to school, workforce amid costly legal battle" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b451e92fa1a5-gettyimages-1238818830.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Kevin Costner's ex Christine Baumgartner claims she'll need to return to school, workforce amid costly legal battle" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Kevin Costner's ex Christine Baumgartner claims she'll need to return to school, workforce amid costly legal battle</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eUXX0VVQ54w data-wc=24>In the court documents, Judge Anderle described Christine as having a "good courtroom demeanor" and found her testimony during the proceedings to be "credible."&nbsp;</p><p id=eFCVljKnIdP data-wc=32>He noted that despite this, Christine's testimony did not significantly contribute to the primary issue at hand. Her statements would, however, be taken into consideration alongside the entirety of the case's evidence.</p><p id=en2Oh6zds-B data-wc=49>Kevin's credibility was also addressed by Judge Anderle. Acknowledging Kevin's profession as an actor, the judge mentioned that this did not influence his testimony. Anderle remarked that Kevin's statements were "straightforward," with no signs of fabrication or undue dramatization. In summary, Kevin's testimony was deemed both "credible and consistent."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8d767df7f066-kevin-costner-wife.jpg><p id=euYcFjdk_oB data-wc=53>Commenting on the presented arguments, Anderle stated that both parties delivered compelling closing statements. As for the final decision on child support, the judge was of the view that the established amount sufficiently addressed the children's requirements. He further elaborated that any amount surpassing the $63,209 would indirectly serve as "disguised spousal support."</p><p id=eUy6f_O7RYn data-wc=38>Anderle clarified that this particular hearing solely focused on child support, adding, "Christine will have her opportunity to convince the Court that she is entitled to spousal support. That is not the issue at hand for this hearing."</p><p id=eZraGrFPEox data-wc=16>Speaking from her perspective, Christine expressed concerns about the potential financial implications on their children, post-separation.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewULfGlETs6 data-wc=26>She revealed that after vacating their family residence, she had moved to a $40,000-per-month rental to maintain fiscal prudence, given the uncertainty of the case's outcome.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4bceb731a6a3-gettyimages-1252692904.jpg><p id=e-N7DvejB5w data-wc=28>Christine's rationale behind her child support request was to ensure a consistent lifestyle for their children, emphasizing that the amount she quoted reflects their prior standard of living.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVN6O0g7xlU data-wc=17>She also mentioned considering re-entering the workforce, potentially in the field of education, to achieve financial independence.</p><p id=e0puBEWArRK data-wc=27>Kevin, on the other hand, voiced his fears over a child support figure that might surpass the genuine needs of their children and inadvertently sustain Christine's expenses.</p><p id=ev9v8RY5YSg data-wc=42>A document submitted by Kevin's legal team ahead of the court sessions contested Christine's allegations about Kevin's reluctance to meet their children's "reasonable needs." They argued that the couple's disagreement was mainly about defining "reasonable needs" in the context of child support.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/40cc43f807de-kevin-costner-children.jpg><p id=eyYCXAZzWLg data-wc=16>The next legal challenge for the pair will revolve around the legitimacy of their prenuptial agreement.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJwWOWUTsKV data-wc=25>Christine's attorney, John Rydell, during a request for order hearing, hinted at a possible divergence from the recent child support ruling in the upcoming sessions.</p><p id=eoy_7tJ5BY2d data-wc=30>Rydell stated: "The other side seems to think that this case is over," and further commented on his longstanding professional experience with the judge, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based decisions.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfl7%2BqsMSsZm5oYmV%2BdHvYnqOlp6eowbC6xKxkpJ2mnrtur86sq6edomKur7CMnq9mm5intrTAyKecZpqRqrqordGtpZ6qo2K5osDErKtmraCZrrWxjJqkopxdmLWquMNmqq6ooKS%2FtXnDoqqpraSafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sentric-music-launches-programme-for-emerging-songwriters.html><span>←</span><span>Sentric Music Launches New Songwriter Accelerator Programme</span></a>
