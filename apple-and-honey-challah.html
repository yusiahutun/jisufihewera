<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>apple and honeychallah</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>This month has came and has now almost gone and I’ve missed it entirely. It’s a shame, because September is my second favorite but less of a shame than it would be if I am still saying the same about October, which is my actual favorite. Nevertheless, I put my foot down and decided I absolutely, unequivocally would not let this month go without at least making you an apple honey challah. Due to my innate gift for impeccable timing (ha), I got the idea for this about two days after the High Holidays ended last year. So, for the better part of 12 months, I’ve plotted this spin on traditional challah and am still about six hours late on it. Typical.</p><p><span id=more-7879></span></p><p><a title="baking with macs" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6154/6192760768_6d0ea545e7_z.jpg alt="baking with macs" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Honey challahs are surprisingly easy — you simply swap sugar for honey, and you can increase it for a stronger honey flavor. Apple challahs, however, are challenging, mostly because larger chunks of baked apple are far more satisfying to bite into you than pea-sized ones, but they’re also tricky to work into a soft dough, and then shape that dough with a traditional braid. Many recipes I saw for apple challah forewent the braid, and baked the bread in a tin instead but it felt too much like cake to me. Plus, I like playing with Play-Doh bread dough far too much to do that. So, I came to two agreements with my dough. One, that I would not put so much apple in that it was more <a href=#>cake</a> than bread, and also nearly impossible to shape and two, that if apple chunks fell out — and of course, they will — I’d just poke them back in. I’m pretty sure you’re picturing me right now negotiating with a large blob of dough on a speckled counter and your premonition would be correct. At least I’m not talking to myself, right?</p><p><a title="spread 2/3 of apple chunks, fold over" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6027/6192244837_b14c7e9d09_n.jpg alt="spread 2/3 of apple chunks, fold over" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a title="spread remaining chunks, fold again" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6167/6192245557_f84ee1523a_n.jpg alt="spread remaining chunks, fold again" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="tuck into ball, ready for rise 2" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6170/6192763250_68267525bc_n.jpg alt="tuck into ball, ready for rise 2" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a title="flatten, divide into four" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6024/6192764196_ea15842952_n.jpg alt="flatten, divide into four" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a title="small center weave" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6135/6192248255_c3ba337d5c_n.jpg alt="small center weave" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a title="weave to the right!" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6167/6192249159_78447f38c3_n.jpg alt="weave to the right!" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="weave to the left!" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6168/6192767124_8fc87366a2_n.jpg alt="weave to the left!" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a title="tuck corners under and behold awesomeness" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6192767638_90098e3d52_n.jpg alt="tuck corners under and behold awesomeness" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The other reason I just had to share this with you was that when I was doing research last year for a different challah that’s going in my cookbook, I came across the best, easiest, coolest way to make a pretty round challah without all of that 6-to-4, 2-to-6, 1-to-3, 5-to-1 brain scrambling of 6-strand braids. Or the weirdness of trying to turn that braid into a round loaf. More of a weave than a braid, I only had to read the directions for this once before I had it down and frankly, have been inventing excuses to make round challahs knowing that this will have them looking bumpy and grand. I hope you’ll find it as simple. I hope that if you’re celebrating the new year, that you have a sweet one and even if you’re not, that you will find excuse to make one of these anyway.</p><p><a title="from the oven" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6160/6192769196_a36e45fe3f_z.jpg alt="from the oven" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="ready for snacktime" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6156/6192770658_4a33a6925b_z.jpg alt="ready for snacktime" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Beef Chili + Sour Cream and Cheddar Biscuits</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Date Spice Loaf</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Black and White Cookies</a> and <a href=#>Summer’s Last Hurrah Panzanella</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Red Velvet Cake</a> and <a href=#>Cream Cheese Noodle Kugel</a>, <a href=#>Spaghetti with Chorizo and Almonds</a> and <a href=#>Couscous and Feta-Stuffed Peppers</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Orange Chocolate Chunk Cake</a></p><p><b>Friday 9/30</b> Do you live near NYC?

Anyone is welcome to attend, most especially you because I bet we haven’t met yet and we totally should.</p><p><b>Apple and Honey Challah</b></p><p>I’ve adapted my challah formula over the years from Joan Nathan’s, and I find her tips about three risings (which won’t take as long as it sounds, promise) and two brushes with egg wash spot on. If you’re looking for a basic challah recipe, <a href=#>here you go</a>. But this one is especially fun for right now, as apples and honey are traditionally eaten together on the Jewish New Year, which begins tonight. And can you imagine how awesome the leftovers will be for French toast?</p><p>I didn’t put any cinnamon in this; I was hoping it would taste foremost like apples and honey but if you’d like cinnamon in there, you could toss the apple chunks with a teaspoon of it. The apples will bake down into almost sauce-like puddles and they manage to remain a little tart. The honey flavor isn’t aggressive, mostly because I didn’t want the challah to be overly sweet (we serve it at dinner, not dessert) but you can always increase the level or just serve it with more honey. I was dubious about the sugar on top of the loaf at first, but ended up enjoying the way it brought out the subtle sweetness of the bread.</p><p>One tip: If you measure your oil in your 1/3 cup measuring cup first, and then your honey, the honey will slide right out.</p><p>Makes 1 round woven challah</p><p>Bread<br>2 1/4 teaspoons (1 standard 1/4-ounce packet) active dry yeast<br>1/3 cup (79 ml) plus 1 teaspoon honey<br>1/3 cup (79 ml) neutral oil, plus more for the bowl<br>2 large eggs plus 1 large yolk<br>1 1/2 teaspoons (8 grams) table salt<br>4 1/4 cups all-purpose (530 grams) or bread flour (578 grams), plus more for your work surface</p><p>Apple filling<br>2 medium baking apples (I love baking with MacIntoshes), peeled, cored and in 1/2- to 3/4-inch chunks<br>Squeeze of lemon juice, to keep them from browning</p><p>Egg wash<br>1 large egg<br>Coarse or pearl sugar for sprinkling (optional)</p><p><u>Make your dough</u>: Whisk yeast and 1 teaspoon honey into 2/3 cup warm water and let stand until foamy, a few minutes.</p><p><u>With a stand mixer</u>: In the bowl of a stand mixture, whisk together yeast mixture, oil, remaining honey (1/3 cup), eggs and yolk. Switch to dough hook and add 4 1/4 cups flour and salt. Use dough hook on a moderate speed until it pulls all of the flour and wet ingredients together into a craggy mass. Lower the speed and let the dough hook knead the dough for 5 minutes, until smooth, elastic and a little sticky.</p><p><u>By hand:</u>: In a large bowl, whisk together yeast mixture, oil, remaining honey (1/3 cup), eggs and yolk. Add flour and salt all at once and stir with a wooden spoon until you get a craggy mass of uneven dough. Turn dough out onto a floured counter and knead it into a smooth, elastic dough, about 5 to 8 minutes. Try to use as little flour as necessary when kneading the dough; you don’t want to toughen the bread. A bench scraper can make it really easy to remove it from the counter if it gets stuck in a spot. [<a href=#>More bread tips here</a>.]</p><p><u>Both methods:</u> Transfer dough to large oil-coated bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 1 hour, or until <i>almost</i> doubled in size.</p><p><u>Add apples to dough:</u> [See photos in post.] Turn dough out onto a floured counter and gently press it down into a flat, oblong shape. The shape does <i>not</i> matter so however it goes, it goes. Spread 2/3 of apple chunks over 1/2 of the flattened dough. Fold the other half over the apple chunks and press the dough down around them, flattening the now lumpy dough. Spread the remaining 1/3 apple chunks over half the folded dough. Fold the other half over the apples, pressing the dough down again. Your dough packet will likely be square-ish. Fold the corners under with the sides of your hands and form the dough into a round. Upend your empty bowl over and set it aside for another 30 minutes.</p><p><u>Weave your bread:</u> [See photos in post.] Divide dough into 4 pieces. Roll and stretch each one as carefully as you can into a rope — don’t worry about getting it too long or thin, just 12 inches or so should do. If any apple chunks fall out as you form the ropes or at any other time in the forming of the loaf or risings, just poke them back in with your finger.</p><p>Arrange two strands in each direction, perpendicular to each other, like a plus sign. Weave them so that one side is over, and the other is under, where they meet. So, now you’ve got an 8-legged woven-headed octopus. Take the four legs that come from <i>underneath</i> the center and move them over the leg to their right, i.e. jumping it. Take those legs that were on the right and again, jump each over the leg before, this time to the left. If you had extra length to your ropes, you can repeat these left-right jumps until you run out of rope. For me, this was enough. Just as you had with the folded packet of apple dough above, tuck the corners/odd bumps under the dough with the sides of your hands to form a round.</p><p>Transfer the dough to a parchment-covered heavy baking sheet or baker’s peel (if you’ll be using a bread stone). Beat egg until smooth and brush over challah. Let challah rise for another hour but 45 minutes into this rise, preheat your oven to 375 degrees.</p><p><u>Bake your loaf:</u> Before baking, brush loaf one more time with egg wash and sprinkle with coarse sugar if you’re using it. Bake in middle of oven for 40 to 45 minutes. It should be beautifully bronzed; if yours (like mine, except I didn’t catch it in time) starts getting too dark too quickly, cover it with foil for the remainder of the baking time. The very best way to check for doneness in any bread but especially on like this where the wetness of the apples can slow down the baking time a bit, is with an instant read thermometer — the center of the loaf should be 195 degrees.</p><p>Cool loaf on a rack before serving. Or, well, good luck with that.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-7879 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-7879 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
