It was made to showcase the capabilities and limits of a 3D printer, plus show how to achieve the proper settings. You can download the model from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official 3D Benchy website</a>, where you will see several options to download the design for free.</p><p>Users are supposed to print the model at a scale of 1:1 without any supports, and the general shape is in such a way that it can challenge any 3D printer during the 3D printing process since it will test the capabilities of every part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rear and front surfaces are parallel, with a cylindrical hole on top. There is also a rectangular front view, and its inner surfaces are parallel. On the sides are two cylindrical stern windows, and on the side are letters and signs extruded at 0.10 mm.</p><h2 id=3d-printing-the-benchy>3D Printing the Benchy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/05/3d-printed-benchy.jpg><p>After downloading the files, you need to print them without adjusting any settings so that you can see how your printer will handle them. The recommended settings are:</p><ul><li>Scale:<strong> </strong>1:1 (The <a href=#>STL file measures 60.00 mm when unmodified</a>)</li><li>Print extrusion speed:<strong> </strong>Up to 50 mm/s</li><li>Print travel speed:<strong> </strong>Up to 150 mm/s</li><li>Print nozzle diameter:<strong> </strong>0.4 mm/s</li><li>Layer height: 0.2 mm</li><li>Infill:<strong> </strong>10%</li></ul><p>On average, the 3D printing process will take around one hour. Once done, you can proceed to troubleshoot the printer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=check-the-overall-quality-of-your-print>Check the Overall Quality of Your Print</h2><p>First, you need to check if the design came out as intended. If everything is fine, you should not have issues like stringing and imperfections on the sides with overhangs. All the details should show it’s a perfect 3D Benchy. If you <a href=#>find that it has 3D print stringing</a> all around the design, for example, it means your retraction settings have issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3d-benches-with-strings.jpg><p>You can adjust the retraction distance and speed from your slicer and see if it fixes the problem.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/retraction-settings-in-cura.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, printing at a high temperature can cause stringing, and you need to play around with settings until you find the optimal value. Moreover, you should dry your filament <a href=#>using a filament dryer</a> before printing to avoid such problems.</p><p>Furthermore, you need to check how the printer prints parts that are prone to warping like the front, the rear, as well as rectangular windows and circles (these sections have overhangs and bridges). For example, for the printer to print the section shown below without having issues, it must be well set.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/rounded-section-of-benchy.jpg><p>Below is a comparison between two 3D Benchys, one that is correctly set and one not. The one on the right has suffered warping.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/two-benchys-one-good-and-another-one-with-issues.jpg><p>To fix this issue, consider adequate cooling so that the filament doesn't have time to sag as it moves from one section to another. Ensure that <strong>Enable Print Cooling </strong>option is checked and the Fan speed value is at 100 % (or you can adjust it to get the most appropriate value for your printer).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cooling-settings-in-cura.jpg><p>If warping occurs on the front section of the design, use a heated build plate and ensure it’s well-leveled before. You can also apply an adhesive like glue as it helps the print to adhere firmly to the build plate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lowering the printing speed fixes these issues too, as the material has enough time to cool before the nozzle moves to the next position.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/printing-speed-in-cura-slicer.jpg><p>The default speed in a slicer like Cura is 50 mm/s, and you can try to lower it and see how it will perform.</p><h2 id=check-the-accuracy-of-your-machine>Check the Accuracy of Your Machine</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/05/checking-dimentions-of-the-benchy.jpeg><p>You need to measure the design using a vernier caliper and see if the values all dimensions are as they are supposed to be. The following are the expected measurements of the dimensions of the parts of the model:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>The front and rear surfaces of the roof:<strong> </strong>They should be parallel to each other, and they should measure 23.00 mm.</li><li>The outer top part of the chimney and the cylindrical hole:<strong> </strong>Each should measure 3.00 and 7.00 mm in diameter.</li><li>Length from the bow to the stern:<strong> </strong>It should be 60.00 mm.</li><li>Width from port to starboard:<strong> </strong>The overall size should be 31.00 mm.</li><li>Height from bottom to top:<strong> </strong>It should be 48.00 mm, and the distance from the top of the box to the bottom should be 15.00 mm.</li><li>Box dimensions:<strong> </strong>The deck should measure 12.00 mm and 10.81 mm on the outside and 8.00 mm and 7.00 mm on the inside. The depth should measure 9.00 mm.</li><li>Rectangular front window: It should measure 10.50 mm and 9.50 mm.</li><li>Sign and small letters: The letters on the stern should extrude at 0.10 mm.</li><li>High-cain spoon bow: It should have a 40-degree overhang on the horizontal plane.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you measure all the above and don’t find accurate values, you have not calibrated your machine accurately. <a href=#>Accurately calibrating your 3D printer</a> is useful when printing designs with fine details and complicated structures.</p><h2 id=examine-the-quality-of-the-first-layer>Examine the Quality of the First Layer</h2><p>Check how the bottom section of your print looks to know how your printer prints the first layer. This is important as the first layer is the foundation of the entire print and determines the overall quality of the design. The letters should be well visible, and the other parts should be smooth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/first-layer-settings.jpg><p>If the text is not visible well, it means your nozzle must be too close to the first layer, and this pushes the filament to be wider than expected, making the text not visible, as shown below.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/05/a-benchy-showing-bottom-section-with-text-not-visible.jpg><p>High temperature can also cause first-layer issues; you need to adjust it until you find the correct settings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3d-printing-temperature-in-cura.jpg><p>Furthermore, if you see gaps between the texts, it means that your nozzle is far from the bed, and you need to lower it slightly.</p><h2 id=check-how-the-printer-controls-temperature-and-cooling>Check How the Printer Controls Temperature and Cooling</h2><p>You should check how the hull of the 3D Benchy has been printed, and if there are any issues, it means there is an issue with temperature and cooling control. If the temperature is higher and the cooling isn’t good enough, you will see blobs, rough surfaces, <a href=#>zits and voids forming on the surface of the design</a>, as shown below.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/zits-and-voids-in-3d-benchy.jpg><p>You need to adjust the temperature, part cooling, and the 3D printing speed on the slicer until you get a smooth finish.</p><h2 id=examine-how-the-printer-handles-intricate-and-fine-details>Examine How the Printer Handles Intricate and Fine Details</h2><p>At the back of the Benchy, there is a small hole, another protruding from inside to the top, and a wheel-like shape inside. If you have set your 3D printer correctly, it should be able to print these details well. If the holes are smaller than expected, you should consider calibrating your extruder. Also, you can adjust the slicer settings to get the perfect holes. For example, in Cura, you can uncheck the <strong>Remove All Holes </strong>setting found on the <strong>Mesh Fixes </strong>setting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unchecking-remove-all-holes-option.jpg><p>This helps prevent the printer from removing the holes even if they are part of the design. Additionally, you should uncheck the <strong>Make Overhang Printable </strong>setting found under the <strong>Experimental </strong>section.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unchecking-option-to-make-overhang-printable.jpg><p>This will prevent Cura from modifying the geometry of the design and that all empty spaces and holes remain in their original parts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=test-the-capability-of-your-3d-printer-with-a-3d-benchy>Test the Capability of Your 3D Printer With a 3D Benchy</h2><p>If you have just received your 3D printer, or you are considering printing a detailed model, it’s essential to do a test print so that you may prepare your machine to ensure that your design comes out as intended. Though there are many test prints that you can use to fine-tune your printer, 3D Benchy is the most preferred as you can use it to test various settings and fix any issue before the actual 3D printing process starts. This saves you time and material that you would have wasted if you had gone straight to printing the model.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirq6ell7mmv8eopq1lY5l6sb7Ip6ueql2strW0jGybZpqVo7CpxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./book-extract-marco-polos-china-travels-have-been-doubted-historian-sees-them-new-light.html><span>←</span><span>Book extract: historian sheds new light on Marco Polos China travels, which have often been doubt</span></a>
