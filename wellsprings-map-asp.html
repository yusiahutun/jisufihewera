They're not entirely wrong. Situated right next to City Center, the buildings are modern-looking, reminiscent of the city's overhaul after the 4th Corporate War. But the further southeast you go, the more the architecture becomes more diminished, older and often neglected. Homes aren't that expensive here – you can even score a 400-something square-foot apartment for a decent price. In other words, Wellsprings is pretty stable until you find yourself in the eastern part of the district, where the houses look like they're about to fall apart and distrusting faces leer at you from broken windows. Valentinos graffiti covers the walls, but as long as you don't get in their way, they couldn't give less of a shit about you. On the other hand, the scavengers to the south... well, let's just say if you've got any ounce of sense in that skull, you won't find yourself there after dark.</p><h2 id=Main-Jobs>Main Jobs <span>starting in Wellsprings</span></h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/game-maps.com/C77/ico/Main-Jobs.png alt="Main Jobs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Main Jobs in Cyberpunk 2077 are quests related to the main plot of the game.
