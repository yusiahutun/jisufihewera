She is about to to lead a self-defence class.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>At the hall, a group of elderly women chat as they rearrange furniture to create space. “It has been a few weeks since we met and it is important to start with warming up,” Beatrice tells them as she demonstrates back stretches, side stretches and touching the floor. Some murmur and joke about how their bodies are struggling to keep up with Beatrice’s.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>One picks up a punchbag and the rest form a line. Screams of “No! No! No!

It is also one of the most dangerous, enduring high unemployment rates, poverty, drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence and crime.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“We started this group in 2007 when we realised that elderly women had become easy targets of rape and abuse,” says Nyariara, a founding member. She was trained for six months by volunteer martial arts enthusiasts and has been leading classes since 2014.</p><figure id=3ada3a45-d544-45fc-a310-73067a6bca5c data-spacefinder-role=immersive data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-2xrvww><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6><ul><li><p>The women take turns to hit the punchbag, shouting ‘No!

However, according to the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Kenya Demographic and Health Survey 2022</a> released this month, 13% of all women reported experiencing sexual violence at some point in their lives, and 7% had met with sexual violence in the past year. The report also notes that 34% of women in Kenya have experienced physical violence since age 15, including 16% in the past year.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Gladys Wanjiku, 80, another Korogocho resident and member of the class, says criminals take advantage of the fact that most elderly women are widows who live by themselves. She says attackers follow elderly women to their houses during the day to see where they live, then return at night. “Locking the door does not help because they come to the house and rip off parts of the wall as it’s made of recycled tins or corrugated iron. They rape and then strangle their victim,” she adds.</p><figure id=89ee0db5-2dfc-4aab-a2d1-9109013742a3 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.MultiImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6><ul><li><p>Group members Gladys Ngang’a, left, and Rosemary Ouma.

The group decided they needed to raise the alarm in a manner that would ensure people would respond. “Today, when the community hears ‘No! No! No! I don’t want anything to do with you’, they know it is an elderly woman being attacked and they come to our rescue,” says Wanjiku.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Rosemary Ouma, 55, had heard about the group but never joined. Her wake-up call came in 2019 when a close friend was raped, killed and dumped at a nearby river. “I was with her in the evening at the market and the next morning my neighbour woke me asking if I had heard what happened to my friend. I rushed to the scene and was shocked. It was very sad what they did to her.”</p>I poked his eyes, then punched him on his ‘potatoes’.

Nyariara’s face shines with pride as she tells of her encounter with an attacker. A few years ago, she was woken up by her door creaking as someone tried to force it open. When she asked who it was, a male voice told her he’d force the door open if she didn’t let him in.</p><figure id=5feeec40-51bf-49e7-bf11-57af18e4fdb4 data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>‘She has let go of the past’: dance eases the trauma for Peru’s Shining Path survivors Read more</a></figure><figure id=c7f4a6b8-b165-416f-824d-1cdd67b3432c data-spacefinder-role=immersive data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-2xrvww><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6><ul><li><p>Shosho Jikinge self-help group members outside the church where they hold training sessions</p></li></ul></span></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“I warned him that if I opened the door, one of us would wind up in a police cell and the other in the mortuary. He assumed I would open the door and wait for him to get in, but I opened it and walked out, poking his eyes with my fingers. He was startled and retreated. I followed him and punched him on his ‘potatoes’.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The attacker fell and Nyariara continued stepping on his testicles as she screamed for help. She had already subdued the intruder by the time her neighbours arrived. “He was screaming: ‘Granny don’t kill me’. This information went across Korogocho and made them fear me,” she says, smiling.</p><figure id=e9b35935-4ff3-4ab9-aff6-b47d4b532dec data-spacefinder-role=supporting data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-a2pvoh><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6><ul><li><p>Fred Ogolla, team leader at community organisation Restoring Dignity</p></li></ul></span></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Sexual assaults on older women are partly a result of myths about their powers. Some young men believe sex with an elderly woman can cure HIV and Aids, while others believe it can cleanse their sins after committing crimes.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Fred Ogolla, team leader at <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Restoring Dignity</a>, a community organisation that supports elderly people in Korogocho, says raising awareness in the community has helped t0 debunk the myths, and today the community is safer.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Apart from self-defence training, the women also run a savings club, known as Chama. For the self-defence class, they contribute 20 Kenyan shillings (13p) a week. “This money comes in handy when a member is unwell or loses a family member,” says Nyariara.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Yet members find it challenging to contribute consistently because they don’t have a steady income. “Sadly, none of us has been included in the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">government’s senior citizen’s cash transfer programme </a>– even though we all qualify,” she says. This means some members stay away from the training. “If you didn’t have supper and breakfast, training is the last thing you’d think of,” says Nyariara.</p><figure id=fc8210d2-bcd4-4cd6-bb22-5a002c975671 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6><ul><li><p>Group members leave after their morning training</p></li></ul></span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJ%2BcpK%2BiuIydnK%2BdnKS9rrHNrWZraGJofKutzWhqaWdoZnq6scCrZKiklGLBs63Ip6Cnn12gsq%2FFwKdksKedmrtuv8SlnWaclZuyr6%2FEZpitrJGYuKa%2B0g%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./green-tea-skincare-benefits-6744537.html><span>←</span><span>Benefits of Green Tea for Skin</span></a>
