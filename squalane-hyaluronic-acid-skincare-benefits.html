Two such ingredients are squalane and hyaluronic acid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both of these goodies are great to use on their own, but together, they're a power couple, especially when it comes to keeping your skin's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>moisture barrier</a> in check.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So let's take a quick second to learn more about the dynamic duo.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-main-benefits-of-squalane></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are the Main Benefits of Squalane?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Squalane — which is the vegan version of squalene — has wonderful hydrating properties and maintains our skin's own moisture barrier," triple board-certified dermatologist and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Terasana Clinical</a>'s Skintellectual Dr. Mamina Turegano shares with InStyle. "Our skin naturally produces squalene (with an "e"), but production decreases as we age."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fortunately, squalane (with an "a") absorbs well into the skin and helps to replenish lipids with no side effects. Plus, it's non-comedogenic and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and microbiome-nourishing properties, according to Dr. Turegano.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-main-benefits-of-hyaluronic-acid></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are the Main Benefits of Hyaluronic Acid?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ever been out all day in the summer, on a blazing hot day, then come back home and thanked God you stored a few water bottles in the fridge the night before so you can feel alive again? Think of hyaluronic acid as that same type of water storage — but for your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Hyaluronic acid is important for moisturizing and maintaining elasticity in the skin," explains Dr. Turegano. "Our skin also naturally has hyaluronic acid. It serves as a humectant, meaning that it pulls in water or moisture in skin cells, which allows the skin to feel more hydrated and 'plump.' This not only gives your skin moisture and glow, but it can also diminish fine lines in the skin."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-should-i-pair-these-two-ingredients-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Should I Pair These Two Ingredients Together?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simple: the two work together as a team to help draw in moisture, then lock it in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"While hyaluronic acid pulls in water to hydrate the cells, the squalane serves more to build the moisture barrier and keep the hydration in the skin, as opposed to evaporating," Dr. Turegano shares. "I recommend using a hyaluronic acid serum, then layering the squalane on top of that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: The Stretch Mark Oil With a 1,000-Person Waitlist Is Finally Back in Stock</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-type-of-skin-ailments-can-hyaluronic-acid-and-squalane-relieve></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Type of Skin Ailments Can Hyaluronic Acid and Squalane Relieve?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pretty much anything that has to do with, or stems from, dryness. Dr. Turegano adds that squalane itself can help to soothe sunburns, treat acne (because of its anti-inflammatory properties), and can even be used for dry cuticles and nails. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hyaluronic acid</a>, on the other hand, can help with wound healing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both ingredients can also be used to hydrate dry hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-which-skin-types-are-these-ingredients-most-beneficial-for></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Which Skin Types Are These Ingredients Most Beneficial For?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Any and everyone who can get their hands on them, pretty much.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Even acne-prone, oily, or sensitive skin would benefit from squalane and hyaluronic acid," the derm shares, adding that it's also helpful for anti-aging. "There are serums that make higher concentrations of hyaluronic acid that would be more helpful with advancing age to help replenish the natural hyaluronic acid that we naturally lose with age and to help diminish the appearance of fine."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-there-a-catch></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is There a Catch?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nope! It's really not too good to be true — unless you're just not a fan of oils in the case of squalane. But luckily, you'll still have options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are still plenty of creams, lotions, or gel-based moisturizers that incorporate squalene into the product," says Dr. Turegano. "But not all squalane is also created equal. I would look for squalane derived from sugar cane — as opposed to olives or sharks — since it is more consistent in quality and is more sustainable. With hyaluronic acid, I do recommend adding a separate occlusive moisturizer layer over the hyaluronic acid product, which allows it to keep the moisture in place. This is more important for those with dry skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another plus?
