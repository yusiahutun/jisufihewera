Former model Lisa B has dark glossy hair, flawless skin, perfect features and...hideously skinny legs!</p><p>It would be easy to say this photograph beggars belief, but, sadly, it does not, as there are similar shots of so many women, including Teri Hatcher, Amy Winehouse, Kate Moss, Victoria Beckham and Sarah Jessica Parker.</p><p>The list goes on and on. They are rich, powerful, successful beyond most of our wildest dreams - yet still they feel the need to have legs that resemble an old chicken's wishbone after it has been sucked clean of flesh.</p><p>The fake-tanned, bandy-legged look has become as essential a component of female fame as talent, or beauty, or youth.</p><p>These super-skinny legs are not attractive, or remotely sexy, but you can rest assured their owners always make sure their pins (and never has a word been so apt) are on display.</p><p>It is as if they were saying: "I deny myself every day to obtain legs like these. They prove how committed I am to fame, to being a fashion victim. I have starved and exercised my way to the top - and I am bloody well</p><p>going to stay here."</p><p>Never mind that two young Brazilian models died from anorexia-linked illnesses. Never mind that pro-anorexia websites - which display pictures of emaciated celebrities and models as "thinspiration" - have mushroomed.</p><p>Never mind that French MPs are to back a new law to bar the media from promoting anorexia; judges may punish those responsible for a magazine photo of a model whose "thinness altered her health".</p><p>No, these women put their careers first. I concede that, perhaps, Kate Moss has never been on a diet in her life, and that Amy Winehouse's emaciation is "fuelled" by addiction, not an iron will.</p><p>But you do not get thighs like these unless something extreme and health threatening is going on in your life.</p><p>Any committed anorexic will tell you that the most difficult pockets of fat to budge are those at the top of the inner thigh. So many young women I have talked to mention the elusive "Bermuda triangle" - that space at the top of your thighs through which, if you are thin enough, there may be a great deal of daylight.</p><p>One 26-year-old anorexic told me that, aged eight, she looked at her chubby thighs and wondered why they were "all joined together, which didn't seem right". She spent the next ten years in and out of eating disorder clinics as she fought to "get the triangle".</p><p><strong>Scroll down for more...</strong></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_04/amywinoPCN2104_468x313.jpg height=313 width=468 alt="Amy winehouse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Unhealthy: Amy Winehouse's scrawny legs are not a good sign</p><p>The real reasons young women want to be thin are complex, and partly enmeshed in a desire not to grow up; to avoid becoming a sexual being.</p><p>The space between the thighs is an indicator, along with the visibility of the breast bone, that its owner does not have sufficient body fat to menstruate.</p><p>Which means she is storing up numerous health problems in later life, including infertility, premature ageing, depression and osteoporosis.</p><p>But the fact remains that these silly famous women believe that they have to be thin not only to be successful but also acceptable. I am not concerned about the health of these self-deluding women.</p><p>When I had dinner with Teri Hatcher in LA not that long ago, she insisted all night long that she was always baking and eating cakes, while picking at her raw salad like a sparrow.</p><p>What does worry me is that legs like hers are now seen to be the norm.</p><p>The sort of thighs we used to see on Marilyn Monroe and Cindy Crawford now seem hopelessly elephantine.</p><p><strong>Scroll down for more...</strong></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_01/lisabDM3004_60x60.jpg height=60 width=60 alt="Lisa B" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Previously, I have attacked on these pages the all-powerful casting directors and stylists who dictate the "look" of the designer catwalk shows. So today, I think, it is the turn of the glossy magazines to take some of the flak.</p><p>One of the recommendations of the Model Health Inquiry was for magazine editors, fashion directors and art directors to announce some sort of moratorium on the excessive use of air brushing.</p><p>In fact, very soon, members of the Association of UK magazine and Periodical Publishers (PPA) are to meet the inquiry's chair, Baroness Kingsmill, and members of the British Fashion Council to discuss how magazines can operate in a more responsible manner.</p><p>A possible "kite mark" to show a picture has not been doctored has been mooted. The PPA is "canvassing views, and looks forward to talks with both the British Fashion Council as well as editors in the magazine sector".</p><p>What a load of hooey! Do you remember the last time we saw a strong, muscular pair of thighs in the media?</p><p>They belonged to curvaceous singer Alesha Dixon, who won the last series of Strictly Come Dancing.</p><p>Recently, she told me how she approached every women's glossy magazine in this country and asked if she could appear on the cover, thighs and all, but with the proviso that her image is not airbrushed. The magazines turned her down. Marie Claire did not even get back to her.</p><p><strong>Scroll down for more...</strong></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_01/lisabDM3004_154x100.jpg height=100 width=154 alt="Lisa B" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>To be honest, a non-airbrushed Alesha Dixon is not a huge gamble. But still, the idea of portraying a woman as she really is was considered too dangerous and circulation-threatening to contemplate.</p><p>Until we follow the French, and force, by legislation, those at the top of the fashion and magazine industries to think less about their pensions and their freebies, and more about the health of young women, and stop holding up women like the one on this page as something to emulate, nothing will change.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6GyboGVbGhqbl%2BIwrGx0WaqpKGeo8ZuuMSgqmarmZi4br%2FEsbBmr5%2Bnv7q1zaCjsmWepL%2BuediorKefXay8rrHNZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shia-lebeouf-car-wreck-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Shia LaBeouf Car Wreck Photos</span></a>
