He wrestled in Mexico, where he learned the Lucha Libre high flying style. He used several ring names, including La Lagartija Verde and Colibri. In 1991, he earned recognition as the "Most Improved Wrestler" in Mexico.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0de86f5fa338e47a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Seth Rollins bio: wife, kids, net worth, movies, and wrestling</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Between 1992 and 1995, Mysterio wrestled in the Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion (AAA), where he feuded with Juventud Guerrera. Then, he teamed up with his uncle in a tag match against Guerrera and his father, Fuerza Guerrera.</p><h2>Post AAA career</h2><p class=align-left>Paul Heyman’s Extreme Championship Wrestling signed Rey Mysterio in 1995. He faced the likes of<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Psicosis and Guerrera </a>before leaving in March 1996 to join the World Championship Wrestling. He started in the Cruiserweight division, where he lost his first WCW Cruiserweight Championship to Malenko.</p><p class=align-left>The next time they faced each other, Mysterio defeated Malenko to win his first Cruiserweight Championship. He remained champion for three months, successfully defending his title against Malenko, Ultimate Dragon and Super Calo. Finally, Malenko reclaimed the title at Halloween Havoc.</p><p class=align-left>Mysterio earned his second Cruiserweight championship by defeating Eddie Guerrero and his third after edging out Juventud. He recovered from a knee injury that kept him out of the ring for six months and won his fourth Cruiserweight championship against Chris Jericho.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c7fc0938acb7f1fc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Álex Palou's bio: nationality, salary, father, wife, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 1999, Mysterio teamed up with Konnan in a tag team match against Kevin Nash and Scott Hall. Mysterio and his partner lost the "Hair vs Mask match", and this was terrible news to him. It meant that the world would see Rey Mysterio’s face for the first time. He has expressed his disappointment over being unmasked.</p><h2>World Wrestling Entertainment</h2><p class=align-left>In the early 2000s, Mysterio wrestled independently after the closure of WCW and appeared in the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. Then, he returned to the United States and worked with IWA Mid-South, Xcitement Wrestling Federation and the Heartland Wrestling Association.</p><p class=align-left>Mysterio signed for WWE in June 2002, where he faced famous wrestlers like Big Show, Kevin Owens and Seth Rollins. He made his debut on July 25 in a win against Chavo Guerrero. After being defeated by Kurt Angle at SummerSlam, he formed a tag team with Edge to participate in the WWE Tag Team Championship. Unfortunately, they lost to Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit but won the rematch two weeks later.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d532e1611a8cbca1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kailyn Lowry's bio: net worth, house, partners, and children</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2003, Mysterio won several Cruiserweight championships and the Tag Team Championships. At the time, Mysterio had a video camera called the "619 cam". He used to tape audience members with the camera during his entrance. Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero feuded after Guerrero slammed Mysterio on the steel steps to show his frustration of being unable to defeat the latter.</p><p class=align-left>The feud ended when Guerrero defeated Mysterio in a steel cage match on September 9, 2005. However, two months later, Guerrero was found dead in his hotel room in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It was a significant loss to Mysterio because Guerrero was his real-life friend.</p><p class=align-left>After nearly 13 years in WWE, Rey Mysterio decided to leave the franchise in 2015. He returned to AAA, and his first tag team match ended with the death of Perro Aguayo Jr. from a drop kick from Mysterio. The cause of the death was determined as cardiac arrest. He returned to the WWE in 2018 and has performed in several franchise divisions, including the Royal Rumble.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/59ac996c00701d68.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Michelle Moyer's bio, Dennis Rodman's relationship, and children</span></p></a><h2>Steroid use controversy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/47c42db3e6ec54f2.jpg><p class=align-left>In March 2007, Sports Illustrated wrote an article detailing an investigation of a steroid and HGH ring used by many <a href=#>professional athletes</a>.
