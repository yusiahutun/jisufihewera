 Last weekend was our wedding anniversary. When I awoke and my husband handed me a neatly wrapped package, I didn’t need to open it to know that what lay inside would be something I’d hankered after for ages. 
It was a Kindle — the exact model I’ve been admiring."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Little did he realise 19 years ago, as he watched me walk down the aisle towards him, that the smiling vision approaching was about to turn into a helicopter wife, hovering over him and attempting to manipulate his every move before the thank-you cards for our wedding gifts had even been posted.</span><br></p><p><span>That’s right — helicopter wife. We’re more used to hearing about helicopter mothers. But trust me, helicopter wives exist in equal abundance — heck, dear reader, you might even be one.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/10/05/article-2045745-0E3F463200000578-878_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Could a wild weekend with the love guru help YOU find the ideal man?</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/10/05/article-2045712-0E3CDEE900000578-381_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>On the couch with Demi Moore: Can relationships with a big age gap ever work?</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p><span>We’re the kind of women who keep our husbands’ diaries and train them to say ‘I’ or ‘we’ but think ‘she’ whenever there’s a decision to be made.</span><br></p><p><span>We think nothing of booking the family holiday without consulting anyone other than tripadvisor.com first. And we’re expert at manipulating our other half’s social life so he finds himself hanging out with the men who are married to our girlfriends rather than any mates of his own.</span><br></p><p><span>The helicopter wife means well, of course. She knows that were it not for her ‘help’ her man would still spend his free time sitting on the sofa playing Xbox, only buying new pants after the old ones finally disintegrated in the wash.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>Frankly, helicopter wife’s husband has relinquished far more control than he ever deserved to have in the first place.</span><br></p><p><span>Deep down he now knows as well as she does that were it not for her organising regular weekend lunches, he’d hardly ever socialise outside work.<br></span></p><p><span>Godchildren’s birthdays would come and go without a card arriving in the post.
