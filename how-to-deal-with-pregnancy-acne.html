But not all ladies are lucky enough to get the glow. In fact, pregnancy acne can be a massive cause of concern for some.</p><h2>So what causes acne during pregnancy?</h2><p id=eHgUIlC5xUh data-wc=85>"Pregnancy acne is the same clinically as acne in non pregnant individuals. It may appear as comedones (clogged pores) as well as red papules, pustules and/or cysts, depending on the severity,"&nbsp;Dr Alexis Granite, Consultant Dermatologist at the Cadogan Clinic, told us. "Acne in pregnancy is most common in the first and second trimesters, and is at least partly due to elevated circulating hormones called androgens. These hormones may cause an increase in sebum production, making the skin more susceptible to congestion, inflammation and bacteria."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2c6cb6446016-pregnancy-acne-z.jpg><p id=erSEYVjXpBt data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Emily Skye shares her pregnancy fitness tips</a></p><h2>What can be done about it?</h2><p id=eO3_SaECon6 data-wc=62>Unfortunately, those with a history of acne, especially hormonal acne, are at higher risk of developing acne while pregnant, Dr. Granite added. So what can be done about reducing the appearance of spots and acne during pregnancy? While strong anti-blemish face washes and products are a definite no-no, there are a few all-natural ranges which are entirely safe to use throughout pregnancy.</p><h2>Products to use for pregnancy acne</h2><p id=eZgmbGN6o_w data-wc=1><strong>Salcura</strong></p><p id=era8mivKCyUw data-wc=104><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Salcura's Antiac range</a>, which deeply cleanses, soothes irritation, and prevents infection, is so popular that the makers even offer a 30-day money back guarantee because they're so confident in its results. Antiac's star ingredient in the range is Sea Buckthorn, a champion of skincare, containing 25 times more vitamin C than an orange. Sea Buckthorn is also rich in omegas and skin essential vitamins, targeting infection to leave your skin refreshed and revitalised. The Salcura Antiac range includes a Daily Face Wash, Daily Face Wipes, Activ Liquid Spray and Activ Gel Serum, which will all help to keep spots at bay while also keeping baby safe.</p><p id=eZzU3jWhM5up data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Top tips for a healthy pregnancy</a></p><p id=evV4uxYQNQkk data-wc=1><strong>Sudacrem</strong></p><p id=eo-ozPVJLYMw data-wc=63>For stubborn spots, many women like to use a targeted treatment or cream on the breakout in a bid to make it disappear.
