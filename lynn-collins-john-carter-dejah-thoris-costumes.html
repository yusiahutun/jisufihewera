Being naked is vulnerable, showing your ass is vulnerable.<br><strong><br></strong>She would never be that exposed [either]. For her it's like "ughhh" and for me at the beginning that's how it was too ... until it was like, whatever, everybody's seen boobs! <strong></strong></p><p>toofab: How did you get in shape for the role? Did you diet?</p><p><strong>Lynn</strong>: I can't really diet because I have hypoglycemia and I have to eat like every 3 hours ... which is actually good for dieting.</p><p>I just had to build muscle, that was my thing. I had just played a heroin addict, I had to come in and build all of this to be able to be harnessed [for the film's rigorous wire work]. And you know, the only way you can really get rid of cellulite is by sweating, so I had to work it out.</p><p>When you work out it's cyclical. You work out to help your body and it releases the stress of worrying about your body, so it's this double affect. As long as I stayed in my routine, I was good.</p><p><strong>toofab: You had to have cheat days ...</strong></p><p><strong>Lynn</strong>: There were things in London called the Queen's Chocolates, which are dark chocolate filled with cream of rose and cream of violet. So good!</p><p>One day I was like, [motions eating them all] and two days later, I go to the trainer and the trainer is like, "What's with your shoulders? Your shoulders look big today." I was like, "I don't know!" -- now he'll read this and be like, "That's what she did!"</p><p><strong>toofab: Your character is a pro at swordplay. What was the training like?</strong></p><p><strong>Lynn</strong>: I went to Juilliard, so I took a lot of fencing and sword training there. And then when we did the training, the same amount of time I was training for physique, I was also training with swords. So it was like 2 hours physique, 3 hours swords."</p><p>See Lynn's impressive physique and equally impressive swordplay in action when "<strong>John Carter</strong>" opens this Friday.</p><p>Check out a 10 minute sneak peek of the flick below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnN7j2xmaW1focavuoycpqWkmaPAbrbOoaVmm5Gnwaa%2BjJ2co5mYYsGpu9Giqmabn6jBtrnErGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tim-mcgraw-curb-records-breach-of-contract-lawsuit.html><span>←</span><span>Remember When Curb Records Sued Tim McGraw?</span></a>
