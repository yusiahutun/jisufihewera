<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Why You Should Be Eating Canned Oysters</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>You’ve likely heard the rumor that oysters give your libido a boost — and there may be some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">truth to that</a> — but what we know for sure is that these delicacies from the sea are packed with essential nutrients that support your overall health. The hitch? Due to their cost and lack of availability, fresh oysters aren’t a go-to for most folks. Plus, some people hate the very things that others love about fresh oysters: their slimey, briney taste. Canned — both boiled and smoked oysters — are much cheaper and easy to find in the grocery store. Plus, they boast a very different taste profile and mouth feel than their fresh brethren.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are canned oysters good for you?</h2><p>Yes — a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">1-cup serving</a> has just 120 calories and boasts 12 grams of protein. And they’re an easy way to boost your daily intake of key vitamins and minerals. Here’s all the benefits canned oysters offer:</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>They are great source of vitamin B — especially B12</h3><p>Canned oysters are a great source of various <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">micronutrients</a> necessary to keep our vital organs and immune system functioning properly. For instance, 1 cup of drained, canned oysters is rich in vitamin B12, containing over 1,400 percent of our daily recommended intake. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The older you are, the more likely you are to have a vitamin B12 deficiency</a> that can result in extreme tiredness and mental fogginess. Canned oysters are also a good source vitamin B1 (22 percent), B2 (22 percent), B3 (14 percent), and B6 (13 percent).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>They are packed with iron for extra energy</h3><p>One cup of canned oysters contain 12 milligrams (mg) of iron — that’s 66 percent of women’s daily needs. Maintaining proper iron levels is important for the health of your whole body, and it also keeps age-related hair loss at bay. “Low iron levels inhibit hair growth — and I’ve also found that women low in iron don’t respond well to hair-loss treatments,” says dermatologist <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">George Cotsarelis, MD</a>. In addition, maintaining sufficient <a href=#>iron levels</a> is crucial for women because iron helps provide oxygen to muscles and aids in hormone production. If you’ve ever been anemic, you know what it feels like: low energy levels and constant fatigue.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>They boast lots of copper for firm, beautiful skin</h3><p>A single cup of canned or smoked oysters contains 873 percent of our daily copper needs. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Copper is important</a> for strengthening the immune system, supporting eye health and maintaining a strong heart and bones. It has beauty benefits, too: Copper increases <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">collagen</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">elastin</a> production in the skin, making it more firmer and more resilient. Though deficiencies are rare, they can lead to heart and bone issues.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>They are a terrific source of selenium to heal the thyroid</h3><p>One cup of canned or smoked oysters contains 115 percent of our <a href=#>daily selenium</a> needs. Selenium <a href=#>strengthens the immune system</a>, benefits <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive health</a> and helps the body fight inflammation. It may also help protect you against cancer and heart disease. You also need it “to keep your thyroid happy and functioning well,” says <a href=#>Sara Gottfried, MD</a>. A happy thyroid means a happy you since it helps you maintain energy, mood, and a healthy weight.</p><p><strong>Tip: </strong>Oysters are also a top source of zinc.

These variables affect the taste, but canned oysters are generally salty and only slightly fishy, easy to bite into and not slimy at all — unlike their raw counterparts. They’re fully cooked and safe to eat right out of the can. The great thing is that you can prepare canned oysters in the same way you would raw ones.
