If you’re someone who gets a thrill out of <a href=#>scrubbing away</a> every speck of dirt or grime in your home — more power to you! Either way, we all want to find the most efficient methods to get any job done. So, when I saw a post claiming to know the best way to clean a bathtub, I was intrigued.</p><p>According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the Kitchn (opens in a new tab)" href=#>the Kitchn</a>, it has nothing to do with wasting money on special cleaners or products to make our tubs shine like new. Instead, we just need to grab the very same soap we use to wash dishes in our kitchen sinks. Yup, they recommend using liquid dish soap in your tub, too.&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Obviously, I had to test this out for myself. It certainly makes sense in theory, our bathtubs are basically huge dishes we stand in to get clean. Sort of like giant, oblong porcelain bowls, right? OK, that sounds weird, but you get what I mean — the material is similar!</p><p>We use <strong>Mrs. Meyer’s Clean Day Liquid Dish Soap (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="$10.95 for 3, Amazon (opens in a new tab)" href=#>$10.95 for 3, Amazon</a>)</strong> on our dishes, so I just waltzed the bottle from my kitchen to the bathroom and gave it a few squeezes. I didn’t smother the tub with the soap, but the small amount did the trick. I’m too embarrassed to show you just how much my bathtub needed a good scrub, but this is what it looked like after just about a minute of wiping away at one area with the dish soap:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/dish-soap-bath-tub.jpg><p>The soap seemed to effortlessly pick up all of the gunk that had built up over time. It only took me 15 more minutes, at most, to get the rest of the tub sparkling, too. This technique was so much faster and far less labor-intensive than the powders and sprays I’ve usually relied on in the past!</p><p>The Kitchn also recommends grabbing a clean broom to scrub like you would with a hand-held brush, but in a way that you’re not bending over and <a href=#>breaking your back</a>. I just used one of my old cleaning rags when I decided to try this out on a whim, but it honestly worked quick enough that my back didn’t have much time to get mad at me anyway. That said, I will definitely try to invest in a new broom, like the <strong>AmazonBasics Heavy-Duty Broom (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="$14.99, Amazon (opens in a new tab)" href=#>$14.99, Amazon</a>)</strong>, before my next tub scrub down to make things even easier on me.&nbsp;</p><p>It shouldn’t matter what type of liquid dish soap you happen to have in your kitchen. If you like the way it gets food off your plates, chances are you’ll be just as happy with its results in the bathtub.</p><p>Give it a try and you just might give up on extra cleaning products for your tub for good!</p><p>We write about products we think our readers will like.
