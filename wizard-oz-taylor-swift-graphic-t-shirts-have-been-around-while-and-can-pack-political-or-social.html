Other nights’ T-shirts read “WHO’S TAYLOR SWIFT ANYWAY? EW.” and “WE ARE NEVER GETTING BACK TOGETHER LIKE EVER”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Keywords “A LOT”, “EW”, “NEVER” and “EVER” were bolded in red. Swifties had been hoping that these red letters meant another of her Easter eggs – hidden messages in computer games, software, film, music – which would, anagram-like, eventually spell out her next production plans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/14/c573c147-c55c-45ba-9913-14ce3dc84001_a230838f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such graphic T-shirts have, of course, been around for a while.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their very first appearance was not in the fashion world, but in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, where three minions stuffing the scarecrow wore bright green T-shirts with the word “OZ” in white, and in the 1940s showcasing United States military branch logos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/14/f6702771-921a-4ee3-9683-40aacef48123_d6cba518.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">T-shirts have long been more than just a fabric covering.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Becoming established as a staple in the 1960s, the once-plain white top, now adorned with typography, quotes or witty phrases, developed into a canvas, a medium for political, social and cultural statements.</p>Text-based or graphic T-shirts have prominent forebears. British designer Katharine Hamnett’s 1980s black block letters spelled out political slogans across oversized white T-shirts. Her first, “CHOOSE LIFE”, worn by Wham!’s <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">George Michael</span></a>, was inspired by a Buddhist exhibit, a comment against war, destruction and death.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/14/7bdf0017-4cdf-4ee3-a002-b6021aa88b61_3d2e8829.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">American neo-conceptual artist Jenny Holzer’s word art, primarily in public urban landscapes, later featured on merchandise, including T-shirts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her pithy statements and longer discourse are always capitalised, with certain parts italicised, to “show some sense of urgency and to speak a bit loudly”. Certainly, as Hamnett believed: “If you want to get the message out there, you should print it in giant letters on a T-shirt.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such text-based fashion has attracted the attention of language researchers: in recent years, the study of linguistic landscapes has expanded beyond the urban landscape to explore other “scapes” such as smells, tattoos and clothing, examining “words we wear”, “banal cosmopolitanism” and “wearable ideologies”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOrJ%2BoqqRiv6atw6xmmqqknrCtsY5saW5tY2d9cMPIs5irnF2kx27AwLKjqKpdqMSqstNmnquZoJ22pHnTZqqhoaKpwG60wK%2BcZpqVmrturdGorKecXay1qrjEZpinnF2Yrq95z5qapGWgpLmqwMicmKVln6d6tLvCopil</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rene-furterer-head-spa-scalp-scrub-review-8620654.html><span>←</span><span>Im Washing My Oily Hair Less Frequently Thanks to This Scalp Treatment</span></a>
