Now in a clip that surfaced later on Monday, 50 reiterated his claim to the crowd at a recent show.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I hate when they leave me to talk because I always say the wrong thing,” he began. “Last time they left me, I said something about Puffy. You saw that clip? I gotta stop doing that kinda shit. I been talking to a therapist to try to help me with the shit I been saying.”</p><p>He continued: “It’s some crazy shit on my mind. Maybe I said that shit about Puffy because he got 2Pac killed.” You can view the clip below.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>50 Cent says he doesn’t like Diddy cause he got 2Pac killed 👀 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/F5mRFnr91W</a></p><p>— Diverse Mentality (@DverseMentality) <a href=#>October 10, 2023</a></p><p>It’s unclear if the clip is new or from the same recent show where <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>50 Cent explained to his laughing audience why he doesn’t go to “Puffy parties.”</a></p><p>“Nuh uh,” he said from the stage. “That n-gga hug you from the front and the back at the same time? Fuck you talkin’ ’bout? I mean, if you into that, you into that. I’m fine with it. I’m just saying this ain’t my motherfuckin’ kind of party. I’m uncomfortable. I think I belong in the girl’s bathroom.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Though he’s wearing the same outfit in that clip and the new clip, it’s possible it may be part of the nightly wardrobe for <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>his current tour</a> – particularly given that he references his prior comments about Diddy in the latest clip.</p><p>50 Cent and Diddy have had a love-hate relationship over the course of several decades.

Yayo believes it was one of the biggest mistakes the label ever made.</p><p>“A lot of people don’t know this story,” he began. “50 went to Diddy for Bad Boy. A lot of people don’t know that. We had the meeting. And it was so crazy that Diddy didn’t sign him – I know that was one of the biggest mistakes of Bad Boy. And you know, the [Kenneth “Supreme” McGriff”] situation — a lot of people were scared of Preme — 50 wasn’t.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I remember Diddy said this, he don’t even remember. … He was like, ‘Yeah, we can’t sign you, playboy. It’s too much. It’s too much drama with the Biggie stuff and all that.’”</p><p>Diddy has yet not responded to 50 Cent’s latest claims.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mhsaWWTmru1ecOorJuklah6pbvWp2SdoZSZxm5%2Bz5qaZqWlp7Gmvg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./news-fans-hilari.html><span>←</span><span>&amp;quot;This should be 10yrs &amp;amp; a fine&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Embraid&amp;quot;</span></a>
