After graduating from high school in 1976, she attended the University of Michigan on a dance scholarship, but she dropped out two years later and moved to New York City.</p><p>Madonna continued studying dance in the Big Apple, but she also started making music, and by 1981, she had her debut single, “Everybody,” ready to go. “First of all, I wanted to make a living. I was tired of being broke,” she recalled to The New York Times in 2019, reflecting on those early years. “But second of all, all I wanted was a song to get played on the radio. That’s all I was praying for. One song.”</p><p>That dream came true and then some. As of 2023, she’s the best-selling solo female artist of all time and is tied with <a href=#><strong>Barbra Streisand</strong></a> for most multiplatinum albums by a solo female artist. “I have something new to say every time I make a record,” she told Entertainment Weekly in 2016. “I think that that’s kind of a no-brainer. I’m not a ‘greatest hits’ kind of girl. You could say it’s reinventing, but a real artist is continuously changing and evolving because the art is continuously changing and evolving. I mean, Picasso didn’t paint the same paintings over and over again.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look back at <a href=#>Madonna’s life and career</a> through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BirqW7zaeYZqyYp7y2s8dmq6GdXa6yor7SZp%2Beql2htqexjKKlZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kriti-sanon-gives-casual-look-in-striped-hoodie-and-denim-shorts-a-luxe-twist-with-fendi-sunglasses-1292227.html><span>←</span><span>Kriti Sanon gives casual look in striped hoodie and denim shorts a luxe twist with Fendi sunglasses</span></a>
