Our fashion reflects our need for efficiency and comfort. Sweater vests, Dr. Martens, leather trench coats—these are simply tools for warmth and endurance. They’ve also become mainstream cool. Lately, it seems like the general public has caught on: Fashion should both look extremely sick and also feel good and powerful. Outfits that were once the domain of queer women have been popularized on red carpets and in street fashion. Seeing a straight-identifying woman wearing overalls, Tevas, and a bandana is somewhat disorienting, sure. But as a millennial who came of age in a deeply homophobic culture, seeing lesbian fashion mainstreamed feels validating, like we were right this whole time.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Look around and you’ll see an oversaturation of denim, loafers, leather blazers (and pants and vests), and JNCO jeans. Any given straight woman named Sarah feels the freedom to dress like Trinity from The Matrix now, an outfit once reserved for intense queer women. High fashion, too, has undergone a sapphic makeover over the past few years, partially thanks to a boost in queer visibility; Kristen Stewart’s Spencer press tour, clad with tweed jackets, wide-leg pants, and two-piece skirt suits, was basically an organized gay recruitment effort. Other celebrities have adapted, too: In November, Dakota Johnson <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.whowhatwear.co.uk/dakota-johnson-suede-jacket-jeans data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=wore class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">wore</a> an oversized suede jacket and baggy jeans, an outfit that felt crafted in a test tube by a lesbian scientist from the ’70s. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nylon.com/fashion/zendaya-barbie-pink-suit-alexander-mcqueen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Zendaya class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Zendaya</a> and Cate Blanchett have all but ensured that women’s suits are the hottest option for formalwear. The possibilities feel endless: What’s next, Halle Berry carrying a sword as an accessory? Linda Cardellini wearing a hooded cloak? (Manifesting this.)</p><img alt="paris, france october 05 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house kristen stewart attends the chanel womenswear springsummer 2022 show as part of paris fashion week on october 05, 2021 in paris, france photo by stephane cardinale corbiscorbis via getty images" title="Chanel : Front Row - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Spring Summer 2022" width=3280 height=4923 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1344916063.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Stephane Cardinale - Corbis</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All this mainstream lesbian clothing has inspired me. I recently wore a suit to a wedding for the first time, and it was magical. Since coming out in 2015, I’ve struggled with overcoming my own internalized homophobia, but I’ve finally experienced enough growth to feel that wearing a suit in such a distinctly heteronormative space was elating rather than scary. I felt thrilled to appear more visibly queer than ever before, to turn a fear of standing out into a proud declaration of such.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I’ve finally experienced enough growth to feel that wearing a suit in such a distinctly heteronormative space was elating rather than scary.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While I feel joyful that lesbian fashion is so beloved today, part of me also feels resentful. Androgynous looks that lesbians were once shamed for, that were once visual identifiers among our own community, are now Urban Outfitters staples. Why should Sarah be celebrated for dressing like Trinity, whereas simply declaring that I liked Dr. Martens in high school drew comments from peers like, “Okay, dike!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, feeling not just accepted but celebrated on a massive scale feels validating and empowering. For me, wearing a formal suit for the first time felt like I was embracing my truest self, one I’ve always been so afraid to fully step into. Not to be so “Dakota Johnson wore a suede jacket and baggy jeans, so I wore a suede jacket and baggy jeans,” but, yeah, I identify with that simp from Mean Girls. Seeing lesbian fashion elevated has emboldened me—whether out of pure joy or pure spite—to become the most lesbian lesbian who has ever lesbianed.</p><img alt="paris, france january 25 gabriella berdugo wears white latte flared suit pants, black shiny leather loafers from prada, outside stephane rolland, during paris fashion week haute couture springsummer 2022, on january 25, 2022 in paris, france photo by edward berthelotgetty images" title="Street Style Day Two - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2022" width=5087 height=3391 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1366915864.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty/ Edward Berthelot</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>We can and we should free ourselves from clothing that makes us feel anything other than our purest selves. <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s also a safety in knowing I won’t be called a dike for wearing something I’ve always wanted to wear but was rightfully fearful to do so. Unfortunately, queer people often have to learn to love ourselves after enduring a lifetime of messaging that tells us not to. So, ultimately, yeah, it feels good to be widely accepted, finally, after decades of feeling the opposite. It also feels comfortable.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My gender presentation has morphed over the years, as has my relationship to clothes. It brings me great joy to see women across the board choosing comfort and efficiency over dictatorial, gendered sartorial traditions. We can and we should free ourselves from clothing that makes us feel anything other than our purest selves.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My question is, Where do we go from here? If we’ve all—queer women, Urban Outfitters, Sarah—collectively agreed that wearing Crocs is simply the best choice for our aching feet, how far can queer women push this? I’ve realized how influential my community is, and now I’m ready to radicalize the gen pop. So I’m speaking this into existence: This summer, the hottest trend is wearing a baggy black T-shirt in the pool and Croakies (in case your sunglasses fall off). And this fall, the accessory you can’t leave the house without is a very small pocket wallet on a chain with just three sleeves for your license, credit card, and insurance card. If you need more room, just carry a toolbox!</p><img alt="girls can kiss now book cover" title="girls can kiss now book cover" width=1400 height=2132 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/girls-can-kiss-now-final-cover-1646853494.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Atria Books</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><br><br>Jill Gutowitz is the author of <a data-stringify-link=https://bookshop.org/books/girls-can-kiss-now-essays-9781797136752/9781982158507 data-sk=tooltip_parent href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex=-1 data-remove-tab-index=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://bookshop.org/books/girls-can-kiss-now-essays-9781797136752/9781982158507 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Girls Can Kiss Now" data-vars-ga-product-id=f33c1862-2e3b-41d9-a807-22f23bdb1918 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://bookshop.org/books/girls-can-kiss-now-essays-9781797136752/9781982158507 data-product-url=https://bookshop.org/books/girls-can-kiss-now-essays-9781797136752/9781982158507 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=3455358&m=97137&urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fgirls-can-kiss-now-essays-9781797136752%2F9781982158507&afftrack=har|xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"6f288e17-82b5-40b9-bf1e-141ac706ae78","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"2706163","merchant_name":"Bookshop.org","network_name":"SAS","network_id":"1","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","metadata":{}},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=3455358&m=97137&urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fgirls-can-kiss-now-essays-9781797136752%2F9781982158507&afftrack={subid}","network_name":"sas","appended_link":"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=3455358&m=97137&urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fgirls-can-kiss-now-essays-9781797136752%2F9781982158507&afftrack={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2024-01-10 10:41:46.978246"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$15.81 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=8c5b0dae-5966-405b-8a72-80b53983bb09 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Girls Can Kiss Now</a>, out now through Atria Books.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaaa2logniBl25mrJmgpbWqr4ysq7KklWK2tHnGqKCnn12irqq60q2pnpmdZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teen-dies-after-car-crash-while-heading-home-from-work-8426937.html><span>←</span><span>N.Y.
