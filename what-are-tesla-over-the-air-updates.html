It's no surprise, then, that Tesla's software requires fairly regular updates to patch security issues and offer new features. But you don't take your Tesla into a garage for an update. Rather, Tesla provides over-the-air updates.</p><p>So, how do Tesla's over-the-air updates work, and are you already receiving them?</p><h2 id=what-is-an-over-the-air-update-in-cars>What Is an Over-the-Air Update in Cars?</h2><p>As the name suggests, an <a href=#>over-the-air (OTA) car update</a> is a software update that takes place remotely, with no physical connection between the device and the update provider. Nowadays, the vast majority of software updates take place in this way, as there are often thousands, millions, or even billions of users that need it around the world.</p><p>Some OTA updates require the user's permission before running, whereas others are automatic. You can usually choose whether you want these updates to be automatic or manual in your system settings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tesla OTA updates ensure vehicle software keeps up with new features and avoids possible hacks. To initiate a Tesla OTA update, your vehicle must be connected to a Wi-Fi network to receive the data.</p><h2 id=why-are-tesla-39-s-ota-updates-important>Why Are Tesla's OTA Updates Important?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tesla-interior-wheel.jpg><p>A Tesla may need a software update for a variety of reasons. Maybe the manufacturer has noticed a dangerous security flaw or a routine update for system performance and feature support is due. After all, if you bought a Tesla in 2018, and your software has remained the same up to the present day, there are likely a lot of new Tesla features and patches missing. This isn't only risky for the user but can reduce the quality of their overall experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Criminals are now targeting EVs</a> in their hacking ventures, and Teslas are not exempt from this worrying trend. Both Tesla vehicles and <a href=#>chargers are vulnerable to hacks</a>, so it's important to install updates so that you can access patches for code vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit.</p><p>After a while of not receiving any OTA updates, your vehicle's system may become incompatible with certain features, slow performing, or exposed to cyberattacks. This is why it's necessary to receive regular Tesla OTA updates where possible.</p><p>Some updates are minor, and you may not notice a difference afterward. But this doesn't mean your vehicle hasn't received valuable changes.</p><h2 id=is-your-tesla-receiving-ota-updates>Is Your Tesla Receiving OTA Updates?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/woman-tesla-display.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When a Tesla OTA update becomes available, you'll likely be notified on your system. If you haven't been notified, head to your Tesla system settings and open the <strong>Software </strong>section. Here, you can see if your Tesla is due any updates and its current software version.</p><p>While you may not be a fan of updates, they can help keep your Tesla's system safe and boost your safety on the road. For example, maybe your hazard detection feature is due an update to detect objects better. Without the update, you're left with the previous version that isn't as effective.</p><p>If you don't want to receive every new Tesla update as soon as it's released (for your location or vehicle model), you can head into your vehicle's settings to select the Standard update mode. To do this, head to <strong>Controls </strong>> <strong>Software </strong>> <strong>Software Update Preference</strong> and select the STANDARD option.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you want to receive new updates as soon as possible, go to the same section of your settings and select the ADVANCED option. Regardless of which option you use, once you initiate the update, it cannot be canceled, and you cannot go back to the previous version of your Tesla's operating system.</p><p>You cannot drive or charge your Tesla during an update's installation period. It's best to initiate an update at night when you know you aren't going to need your car and the Wi-Fi connection is stable.</p><h2 id=tesla-39-s-ota-updates-are-far-from-futile>Tesla's OTA Updates Are Far From Futile</h2><p>You may think Tesla's software updates are inconvenient, but they have value. To improve your vehicle's performance and enhance safety, it's wise to consider initiating updates to get the best service and experience possible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoZmkYq6zsYytnKykkWK8t7HRZquhnV2WtrN51KmbmqyVqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./654956d9268e3eb44e8b45d5-html.html><span>←</span><span>Totalplay solo internet: precio y paquetes en 2023</span></a>
