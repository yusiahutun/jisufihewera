<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The Best Turkish Cotton Robes That You Can Buy on Amazon</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>With how long women spend showering, bathing and getting ready, you should make sure you have a fantastic bathrobe in your arsenal — especially if you spend half of your weekend and weekday evenings in your robe. Robes are the ultimate <a href=# id=auto-tag_loungewear data-tag=loungewear>loungewear</a>, after all. You want a robe that’s cute, long-lasting and, of course, comfortable. If you want your robe to feel like a towel, so you get a second opportunity to dry off, you should check out Turkish cotton robes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Turkish cotton mimics your bath towel in the best way possible. It wicks moisture away from your body and absorbs it, while drying you off. Despite absorbing all of that water, it remains relatively dry. You’ll find that spas, hotels and pools usually carry Turkish cotton towels if that helps you imagine what Turkish cotton <a href=# id=auto-tag_bathrobes data-tag=bathrobes>bathrobes</a> feel like. This type of robe is made out of cotton from Turkey and is harder. It tends to become fluffier over time, which is good news for shoppers who want something cozy to curl up in.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/elwood-fi.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/laura-mercier-powder.jpg><p><span>We rounded up the best turkish cotton robes that’ll help you make the transition from shower to fully dressed (even if that transition takes four hours).

TowelSelections Women’s Robe</h2><p><span>Super soft with moisture-wicking properties, the robe acts like a towel and absorbs water from the shower or pool. You won’t feel cold or wet after showering on a freezing night. Made in Turkey from 100 percent Turkish cotton, this bathrobe from TowelSelections is styled as a Kimono terry robe. It has two pockets and a sturdy tie, so the robe will stay closed. Available in colors from pink nectar to deep sea, you’ll be able to find a shade that suits you.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/towelselections-turkish-cotton-bathrobe-amazon.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31EcKBoC7lL._SL500_.jpg><h2>2. Arus Women’s Hooded Classic Bathrobe</h2><p><span>If you want a Turkish cotton robe that’ll cover you head to (nearly) toe, this Arus robe is a great pick. The robe has a hood that can drape over wet hair and pockets to put your phone in. Or if you’d rather just put your hood up and burrow into your couch, that works, too. This robe will keep you cozy and dry after a swim, dip or shower. The bathrobe comes in six different colors, ranging from burgundy to latte.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/arus-turkish-bathrobe-amazon.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31ZelO3-QjS._SL500_.jpg><h2>3.
