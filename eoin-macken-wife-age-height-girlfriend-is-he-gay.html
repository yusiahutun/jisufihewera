He started modeling and acting at about the same time but found success in the former before making progress in the latter. Over the years, Macken has had several notable acting successes, but he has gained a lot of prominence through his extensive work on the small screen. He is known to television audiences around the world for his role as Sir Gwaine in the BBC hit series, Merlin. He is also known for his leading role in the 4-season medical drama series The Night Shift and several others.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who is Eoin Macken? Age</strong></h2><p>Eoin Christopher Macken was born on February 21, 1983, in Dublin, Ireland. Information about his early life is not available, but we do know that he started his showbiz career during his college years. He modeled at the 2002 and 2003 University College Dublin fashion shows, after which he was signed to a modeling agency. His modeling career then became very busy as he worked with some of the biggest names in fashion such as Abercrombie and Fitch, Ralph Lauren, and GQ magazine.</p><p>As his modeling career took off, Eoin Macken also found his way into acting. His first major acting role was in the sports comedy Studs (2006), followed by roles in several other independent films. In 2008 he made his cinema debut in the 19th season of the long-running series Fair City, in which he appeared as drug dealer Gavin Cluxton.</p><p>As Macken was still a budding actor, he decided to explore the behind-the-scenes aspect, and so he wrote, directed, and starred in his feature film debut Christian Blake (2008). He repeated a similar feat in his second feature film Dreaming For You (2009). Macken was also the director of The Fashion of Modelling, a one-hour documentary about the Irish fashion industry that was broadcast on RTÉ 2 in May 2009. The multi-talented star has also starred in several television series and telefilms.</p><p>Eoin Macken’s groundbreaking role came in the hit series Merlin (2010-12) on BBC One, in which he portrayed the recurring character Gwaine. The series has since gained a large fan base, and Macken’s role has made him popular with television viewers around the world. He was given an even bigger role in the NBC medical drama series The Night Shift (2014-17), in which he plays the lead role of Dr. T.C. Callahan. Macken also starred in the telefilm Killing Jesus (2015) and the blockbuster Sci-Fi movie Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016).</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Francesca Eastwood Biography, Siblings, Is She Married, Who Is Her Husband?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family</strong></h2><p>Eoin Macken’s father was a lawyer and his mother earned her own living as a nurse. He grew up with his two sisters Niamh and Freya. Just like her famous brother, Niamh Macken is also active in show business, not as an actor but as a special effects artist.</p><p>Unfortunately, Macken’s father James died in 2007 after suffering from a brain tumor. However, the movie star has kept the memory of his father very strong in his heart. He owns a unique necklace that features his father’s wedding ring and an Egyptian pendant of his mother. A rather eccentric piece of jewelry!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Wife, Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>Publicly available information indicates that Eoin Macken was never married. However, it is possible that this movie star will take this big step sometime in the near future. It is known that he has a relationship with the great British-born actress Anya Taylor-Joy. The details of their relationship are still somewhat sketchy, as the couple has kept their romance rather reserved. It is reported that they have got engaged and therefore could soon walk down the aisle.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Matthew Fox Wife, Kids, Family, Age, Height, Net Worth</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Eoin Macken Gay?</strong></h2><p>Eoin Macken’s sexuality has never been questioned, as his dating history has been described in great detail so far. Before his current relationship, he had already had several other romantic relationships, all with members of the opposite sex. He has been with both the Irish musician Una Healy and the Irish actress and singer Kellie Blaise. It is therefore quite clear that this Merlin star is attracted to women.</p><p>However, Eoin Macken is a great supporter of the LGBT community. He lent his voice to the 2015 referendum to legalize same-sex marriage in his home country Ireland.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height and Other Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>Eoin Macken is 180 cm (5 feet 11 inches) high. He has a slender build with a bodyweight of 80 kg (176 lb). His chest measurement is 117 cm (46 inches), while his biceps and waist measurement is 43 cm (17 inches) and 81 cm (32 inches), respectively.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksrC1zWakmpubmrtuw8ifnGaZl5p6qbHIoJ%2BtZZeev62y0aKcp5xdnsButMRmnpqxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emmys-kieran-culkin-uses-the-big-win-to-demand-something-special-from-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Emmys: Kieran Culkin uses big win to ask for something special from his wife</span></a>
