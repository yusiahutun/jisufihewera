Out of all the types of products, eye cream is undoubtedly the one I get asked about the most. Why? Even with Botox and other types of injections, fine lines around the eyes are the trickiest to tame. Fortunately I found the most effective eye cream to treat the area surrounding your eyes — <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">SkinMedica TNS Eye Repair</a> — and my MIL (and lots of other people in their 50s, 60s and even 70s) order it on repeat.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I have tried endless skincare products, but I <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>keep going back to SkinMedica</a>, the skincare line backed by Botox brand Allergan. One of my favorites is <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">TNS Advanced+ Serum</a>, fueled with the brand's patented TNS-MR, a "growth factor blend" that supports healthy skin functions, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Nazanin Saedi, MD</a>, board-certified dermatologist at Dermatology Associates of Plymouth Meeting, previously told InStyle. How exactly do growth factors work? They are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>scientifically proven</a> to regenerate tissue, promoting healing and building the underlying skin matrix. "It makes the skin stronger overtime by giving it more structural support," Saedi said.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skinmedia</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">SkinMedica took that same growth factor blend, added <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">retinyl palmitate</a> (a more gentle derivative of vitamin A), peptides, and vitamins C and E, and made the perfect anti-aging eye cream. I could tell you what I love about it, but my 73-year-old mother-in-law can offer a better endorsement. “I’ve tried countless other eye creams and, so far, this is the best,” she says. “I have very crepey skin under my eyes, along with dark, dull circles, making me always look even more tired than I already am. Also, I have very sensitive skin, and many eye creams cause irritation and itching.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She adds that the SkinMedica eye cream is “very emollient,” goes on smoothly, and absorbs well and quickly. “It seems to tighten the crepey skin and definitely appears to reduce the dark circles. I love it,” she says. Another bonus? A major fail of so many eye creams is that they don’t pair well with makeup. However, “once it’s applied under the eye makeup, like concealer, goes on flawlessly,” she notes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many Amazon reviewers agree. One <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">58-year-old shopper</a> claimed she’s been using the eye cream for five years. “My eyes aren't aging,” they wrote, deeming it the “best eye cream on the market.” While it’s a bit of an investment, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">another reviewe</a>r maintained that it is an “excellent value for the money.” A <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">final shopper</a> said that they “could not believe the difference” in their under-eye bags and dark circles, and added that a little bit of the product goes “a long way.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While this product is perfect for aging eyes, I also love <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">SkinMedica Instant Bright Eye Cream</a> (which is also on sale!); it’s slightly less expensive and works just as well for dark circles, puffiness, subtle sagging, and fine lines.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s the deal: Now is the time to order <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">SkinMedica TNS Eye Repair</a> while it’s 20 percent off on <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dermstore</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qSgp6WVmbakrYytpaxlla6ybr7EqZiiql2Yv6atzGapnq6ZmsRuhJNqaWtqZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meagan-fitzgerald.html><span>←</span><span>Meagan Fitzgerald Biography</span></a>
