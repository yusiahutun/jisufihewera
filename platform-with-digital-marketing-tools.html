A brand-new hire who’s not sure how to make an omelet (despite presenting you with a lengthy, stellar CV that would make you think you’re hiring Gordon Ramsey). Or, how about another waiter forgetting orders and making customers wait for 20 minutes?&nbsp;</p><p>A person not well-suited for the role of a waiter, manager, or cook can do more harm than good to your restaurant business.&nbsp;</p><p>Following what was the worst pandemic in quite a long time, both employers and employees are finding themselves confused about approaching the work market.&nbsp;</p><p>To hack the confusion away, what you may want to do is get a brand-new approach to the hiring process that will help you eradicate the bad fits for your business and attract the right kind of worker.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, we’re going to talk about the innovative hiring techniques you can employ to get your dream waiter, cook, and staff manager that will propel your business to new heights. Also, we’ll talk about the apps you can use for this purpose.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Problems With the Hiring Process&nbsp;</h2><p>Accidentally hiring an underqualified or otherwise unfit candidate can happen to even the best of hiring managers.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2.1-The-Problems-With-the-Hiring-Process-1024x683.jpg><p>That said, there are forces out there on the market that can be rather tough to foresee, which can make finding the right person for waiting tables and cooking broths way more difficult than it would otherwise be.&nbsp;</p><p>From President Biden showering everyone with cash and inadvertently discouraging the populace from seeking work, to candidates lacking in talent or willingness to learn, the present-day employment landscape leaves much to be desired.&nbsp;</p><p>In the passages below, we will talk about the ongoing problems with the hiring process that many employers can unfortunately relate to.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Unemployment Benefits&nbsp;</h3><p>First things first, following the catastrophic worldwide phenomenon of COVID-19, the global economy started going topsy-turvy as no one was sure how to approach hiring new people after the whole thing was sort of over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, many countries decided to hand out cash handouts to jump-start their economy and get people to buy more products. That said, some governments implemented versions of this general plan that worked better than others.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to the United States, Biden’s rather pricey $1.9 trillion ‘American Rescue Plan’ included sections that gave people more than they would earn working a minimum wage job. Thus, the incentive to find work was virtually demolished overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As more and more states see the errors of giving people free money, however, so will the legislation whimper down to a more reasonable amount dedicated to benefits.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Talent Shortage&nbsp;</h3><p>Finding the right people to work in your restaurant is not just about picking someone off the street, dressing them up in a waiter’s costume, and having them serve someone a coffee.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on your restaurant’s policy, you may be looking for younger people or folks with tattoos and a bicycle collection that also likes home-brewed beer.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2.2-Talent-Shortage-1024x683.jpg><p>Following the pandemic, there’s been a massive shortage of workers <a href=# rel=noopener>suitable for the restaurant business</a>.
