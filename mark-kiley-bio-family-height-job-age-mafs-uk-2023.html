Sean’s friends nicknamed him “Brutal Barry” for his outspoken and honest opinion which has landed him in trouble previously. When it comes to love, Sean came out later in life and has admitted that feeling “misunderstood and confused” led to years of him missing out on the gay dating scene. He’s never had “anything near a relationship”, but now in his thirties, he’s ready to commit – with the experts’ help!”</p><p>Before appearing on MAFS, he appeared on Channel 4’s other dating show Dates Back in 2017.

As long as he’s got a good kind nature I’ll be over the moon.”</p><p>Sean is conscious of the fact that he needs to make some improvements before settling down.</p><p>“Something I do that my husband might not like about me is that I’m very, very messy. I’m used to living on my own. Best start tidying up after myself.”</p><p>Sean is a 31-year-old who works as a store manager.

You are more loved than you will ever know! Having you as my mum makes me feel like I’ve won the lottery every single day! I hope this year is the best ever for you, no one on this planet deserves it more than you. I love you.. we all love you. X.”</p><p>Mark has posted about his grandmother who passed away in November 2022. He captioned the post, “Can’t believe it’s been a year today since you were gone.
