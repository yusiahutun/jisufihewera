The two teamed up just last year for the Showtime series City on a Hill. Bacon stars as a Boston cop in the early 1990s and Sedgwick was on set to direct one episode (so far).&nbsp;</p><p>Though they loved working together, Bacon apparently had a hard time remembering to stay totally professional when his wife was on set. While visiting The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the actor admitted Sedgwick chastised him for being a bit too touchy-feely in front of the cast and crew. “We’re very affectionate people, you know,” he explained. “She said to me once, ‘Please don’t touch me there, you know, while we’re working.” Although, he didn’t go into more details about where “there” might be, we can imagine it was something like a li’l pat on the tush.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, that’s not something you’d want your partner to do while you’re the one making important directorial decisions about an episode, so we understand why she had to shut him down. You can hear more from Bacon about working with Sedgwick and the series in the clip below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Despite having to calm themselves down at work, how sweet is it that the couples’ passion hasn’t dwindled after three decades of marriage? And they clearly have plenty of respect and admiration for each other, too. It reminds us of the couple who, after being <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">married for more than 80 years</a>, said the secret to their success was “just being nice to each other.” Hey, that’s a pretty easy tip to follow! And one we can only assume Bacon and Sedgwick already stick to in their relationship.</p><p>Hopefully we’ll hear even more adorable stories from the <a href=#>famous couple</a> for years to come!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2Bgsre1zWaZmpufo3qiusNmorKqkWLAprDGsKCco12irrO%2ByJqenmVhbH51gZQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-use-amazon-smart-reordering.html><span>←</span><span>How to Use Amazon Smart Reordering</span></a>
