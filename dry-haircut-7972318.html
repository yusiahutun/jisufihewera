According to hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Yetty Bames</a>, this is mostly used to give pros the best visibility and avoid giving you harsh lines. Fellow hairstylist&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Roz Murray</a> agrees and says that dry cutting allows them to tailor a haircut specifically to your texture and hair needs.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Andrew Fitzsimons</a> says that dry cutting can help stylists see more clearly when trying to shape and style hair. “Wet hair can appear longer and is naturally weighed down, so when you are cutting hair dry, you get a very even cut and true length as you are working with your natural hair texture,” Fitzsimons explains. “When the hair is dry, you can see the length and feel the weight a lot more clearly than you can if the hair is washed first.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Dry cutting lets the stylist see the hair for what it really is, which results in perfecting the clients desired length, haircut, and style,” adds Bames. “Dry cutting is also beneficial to those with weak and damaged hair...as a wet cut requires tons of combing and cutting, which can further weaken the hair. A dry haircut is done, styled, and perfected, so there is less time spent doing the service while inflicting less damage.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Murray agrees and adds that dry cuts help determine where the dead ends that need chopping are, which is especially helpful when you’re trying to maintain as much length as possible.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-downsides-of-dry-cuts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Downsides of Dry Cuts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>The downsides of a dry haircut are minimal. According to Fitzsimons, the only real drawback of a dry cut is that any mistakes made are a lot more visible and harder to fix. “This is due to the fact that you can see the way the hair will lay naturally with the length. So if a wrong move happens, it will be more noticeable,” he says. Bames agrees and adds that because a dry cut is so precise, it’s easier to mistakenly cut the hair unevenly or add a hole when giving you layers.&nbsp;But if you go to a trusted and well-trained stylist, you can avoid experiencing these mistakes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-dry-cuts-are-popular></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Dry Cuts Are Popular</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>Simply put, dry cuts are so popular because they benefit both the stylist and the client. Murray emphasizes that dry cutting lets the stylist tailor the cut specifically to the client’s texture and needs, and the client will leave with the exact cut and style they were looking for.&nbsp;It's pretty much a win-win for all parties involved.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hair-types-dry-cuts-work-well-for></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Hair Types Dry Cuts Work Well For</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>Dry cuts are suitable for all hair types. "We all ultimately wear our hair dry," says Bames. However, those with curly and coily hair will benefit more from a dry cut. That's because these hair types experience shrinkage when wet, which makes it "near impossible to see the hair for what it really is," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fitzsimons agrees. "With a dry cut, it is easier to account for different textural and coil differences in curls," he says. "With certain dry methods, you can immediately see the results."&nbsp;So, the next time you book an appointment with your stylist, consider asking them about getting a dry haircut. With all the benefits and ease it comes with for both you and the stylist, it's inherently a no-brainer.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w6uwZqCRnr%2BkwdNmbnJvYmh%2BeQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./florida-woman-attacked-bear-says-whack-doo-neighbor-regularly-fed-them-html.html><span>←</span><span>Florida woman who was attacked by a bear says her neighbor regularly fed them</span></a>
