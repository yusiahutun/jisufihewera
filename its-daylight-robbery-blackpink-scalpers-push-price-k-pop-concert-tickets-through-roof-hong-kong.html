In response, Live Nation Taiwan, the group’s world tour organiser there, cancelled the tickets in question.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s also a boom time for scammers. Last week, two female Blackpink fans in Hong Kong lost HK$17,000 (US$2,200) to an online con.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong Police have urged fans only to buy tickets through official channels. “In just a week, police have received 25 reports of online shopping fraud related to [Blackpink] concert tickets,” it said on its anti-scam Facebook page, CyberDefender.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Earlier this year, Hong Kong superband Mirror urged fans to “say no to scalpers” when tickets that were originally priced at HK$1,280, HK$880 and HK$480 were reselling for up to HK$440,000 (US$56,000).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/29/af8cae6c-68f2-435d-bb3f-6971f00af4be_a3b478f4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Scalping is illegal in Hong Kong.
