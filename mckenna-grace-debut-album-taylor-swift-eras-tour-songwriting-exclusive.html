"I'm the kind of person [for whom] dating and kissing is a big deal. If I'm with someone or I'm going to kiss someone, I want it to be special. And I'm honest about that.</p><p id=eK_Tw1y4YTx data-wc=55>"For me, it's about being love bombed into trusting someone and going out of your comfort zone with them, only for them to have not actually been that serious about you. It's funny because I act for a living, but it always surprises me that someone can look at you and just not be honest."</p><p id=eBuivE1PBx data-wc=14><strong>TRENDING:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Ryan Gosling finally celebrates long-awaited news hot on the heels of Barbie success</a></p><p id=e-PtPaY8NwW data-wc=59>McKenna cites <a class=hm-link href=#>Olivia Rodrigo</a> as a key musical role model, but says <a class=hm-link href=#>Lana Del Rey</a> was her inspiration for the track, specifically her 2014 song 'Pretty When You Cry'. And the influence is clear in the song, with its confessional lyrics and narrative arcs that verge into singer-songwriter territory. And, yes, there's another 30-something singer McKenna looks up to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7e11788fa0e0-mckenna-grace-i-tonya.jpg><p id=eiLdP_Bj0fO data-wc=56>"As typical as it is, Lana Del Rey and <a class=hm-link href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, they're fantastic. They're just the best storytellers," she gushed. However, like many others affected by the Ticketmaster debacle (RIP), she wasn't among the throngs at Taylor's massively successful The Eras Tour – although a certain male co-star did catch a show, much to her chagrin.</p><p id=eVMGV8Hl473 data-wc=72>"I wish! I've been dying to go," she tells us, recounting a recent experience from a film set. "I've just been watching all the little videos. I was working on a set, and <a class=hm-link href=#>Paul Rudd</a> left and went on The Eras Tour, and I was like 'Take me with you!'" The hilarity of the moment wasn't lost on her: "I know!

And she's ready to write more, watch more, act more, and do it all over again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dYWYbGhyZ52YuKa6zZpkoKqRmLJusMSbrK1lkaGvtrmMrZiypJ%2BnerTDyJ%2BrZp2ilsBuwM6uqWarn6O0uL7IraCnn12axaS41Kygr51f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivia-rodrigo-merch.html><span>←</span><span>Best Olivia Rodrigo Merch &amp;amp; Gifts 2023: Amazon, Etsy, &amp;amp; Target</span></a>
