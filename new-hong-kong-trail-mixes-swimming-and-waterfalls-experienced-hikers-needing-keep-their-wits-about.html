It is the only village in the collection of islands called Double Haven, a stunningly peaceful isolated sanctuary.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">You have to hike and swim between the islands to get to section two.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong’s 5th major trail commemorates late legend Nic Tinworth</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once on the mainland, the next 11 sections combine swimming, coasteering, and stream-hikes up waterfalls with intimidating names such as Stone Dragon, Flying Ape Gorge and Dragon Ball.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There’s one on a stream called Ghost Anger,” Ross said. “It’s a really narrow, dark, flat stream. It’s not very interesting at all. When you can go along this stream for about an hour, you’re thinking ‘OK, fair enough’ – there’s no pools to swim in or anything like that.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And then all of a sudden it just opens up and there’s this huge waterfall. And then you have to go up this cliff and at the start it’s OK. But then at the end there’s a bit of rope. You’re looking down and thinking, ‘I have to keep my wits about me here’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/07/1d709ff7-a148-4584-aedf-8bcf66b4486b_6a7afcfd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the route’s website, Argyle and Ross have rated each section for difficulty out of five. The Kwun Wat to Tuen Mun leg they consider the easiest part, with beach swims and walks for less-experienced hikers wanting to get a flavour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And as well as the beauty of the countryside, the route also weaves in and out of cultural points such as restaurants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We love doing a hike and at the end having a beer or some foods because you’re obviously absolutely starving,” Argyle said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/07/dae6efb4-7c57-4e22-a228-09e5ec7b82b5_bc474711.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So we wanted to, as much as possible, try and end where there would be a nice pub or a bar or a restaurant, but also somewhere unique, somewhere different, going with this whole trend of the trail being very, very different to the other ones.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One section finishes on Route Twisk at a dim sum restaurant, and another finishes in Sham Tseng near a famous goose restaurant.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pair came up with the idea when hiking last June. They started to mentally map together all the parts they’d done and the rest followed. The first half was very familiar to them, but the second was new territory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The west was a little bit like the wild west. We had to question different bits – is this going to work?” Ross said. “That’s what I loved about it because I’ve been here for 12 years. I’ve hiked the whole of Hong Kong, but it just introduced me to so many surprises.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/07/af513b4c-5697-4809-b779-503a21e35540_d40e4bb7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even the parts they were familiar with became hairy at times. Near Pat Seng Leng they lost their way</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was getting dark and we thought ‘OK, well this is a bit of a problem now’,” Ross said. “And Jack’s quite gung ho about things. So he says, ‘oh, let’s just bushwhack’.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’re 630 metres up – if we try to bushwhack, it’d probably take about a week, and it’ll be a helicopter rescue, without a doubt. But we did, we managed to find the ribbons [marking the trail] again.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/07/930253ca-6637-49e8-8742-baf2ae5d250c_43d5ad2f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With that experience in mind, the pair have tried to design the route so it is unique and challenging, but not so hard to navigate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The record for running the 100km MacLehose Trail is under 11 hours. Argyle and Ross think it would take at least six days to do their route in one go. But because of the need to scramble and swim, the camping gear would have to be minimal; things such as hammocks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You can’t rush the streams. It’s dangerous. You’ve got to take it slow. The swims slow you down. It moves it from maybe a four-day into a six-day minimum, maybe even seven-day thru-hike,” Ross said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Argyle added: “It’s tough. And you kind of have to have the right weather as well, because [of the streams] you have to have some pretty clear weather for that week. So it’s not an easy window to find, which obviously makes it even more tough.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pair are currently concocting some awards for the first people to do the whole trail and the first to thru-hike it, without going home, to mark the achievement.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is a difficult trail,” their website reads. “For those that love water and seek real adventure beyond anything else offered by other long distance Hong Kong trails.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqK2kmbywvo6hoKShnpx8or7TopqlnV9of3aAk3FwaKaVrHqpu82gZKSnnpx6tb7AoqNmpZmtsrR50rCgpqWZo7Rurc2dZLCZpJq%2Fp63LpapmnailsrO1xKeanpxdnbassdGsZKedlZm2r7OMpJyeqF2ptaa10WauoqyjYq6ju9St</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./geri-halliwell-wedding-dress-style-princes-trust.html><span>←</span><span>Geri Horner looks like a beautiful bride on special night out with Holly Willoughby</span></a>
