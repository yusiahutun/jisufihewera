"A picture came up on my phone, and I went, 'I look so great!' But I also remember that at the time [of that photo], I thought I was overweight and needed to do all these unhealthy things."</p><p>"We just beat ourselves up constantly, and we're never perfect enough," she added.</p><p>The "Game of Thrones" star said seeing the photo brought her to the realization that she mentally had to "hack the system" and change her point of view with her body image. Emmanuel will now catch herself before falling back into the cycle and will ask herself: "What is it you want?"</p><p>When it comes to wellness, Emmanuel said she "had to change how I interacted with exercise and decide what I wanted to get from it."</p><p>The "F9" star went on to explain why she enjoys doing yoga.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:cdbe1420-f465-4529-9f5e-e5a618b25213 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f933fb84-b601-4e39-872a-d04fb8829494 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/63/5by4/2021/04/29/635bc95afedf47839fe6bff8cda6020b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jessica Simpson Reveals She Threw Away Her Scale, Has 'No Idea' How Much She Weighs</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"What I love about yoga is there's no pressure to be the best at it. Even if you just lie on your mat for the hour and breathe with intention, you're doing yoga," Emmanuel shared.</p><p>She revealed she first got involved with yoga many years ago when she was 18.</p><p>"My mental health was deteriorating, and I took my first class in reaction to it," Emmanuel said.</p><p>"The Scorch Trials" actress is also vegan, a diet of which she initially tried out for a week. However, after she received positive results, including a better night's sleep, she continued with the diet.</p><p>"Then I did it for two weeks and felt even more energized," she explained. "And then I was like, "That's it; I'm going for a month!"</p><p>During a trip home to England, Emmanuel ate some of her mom's "delicious" nonvegan cooking, only to find that the food didn't make her feel well. She then decided to become a vegan -- and still is eight years later.</p><a id=gallery-link-54f46487-a746-4ca8-b24e-6ebb938407be class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:54f46487-a746-4ca8-b24e-6ebb938407be data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:f933fb84-b601-4e39-872a-d04fb8829494 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0f/4by3/2021/06/18/0f96cdca30f84508aad7f35e1dc4cc6d_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j29ma2pfo661tMCloJ5llaK6orrUnqNmp6Cau7R51KlkqZmjqXq0wNGunqCklWKvsLDYZqCmmZeafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./liz-cambage-and-alex-lee.html><span>←</span><span>Liz Cambage and Alex Lee</span></a>
