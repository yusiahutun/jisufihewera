Olive leaf tea is made from steeping fresh or dried olive leaves in boiled water for about five minutes. It tastes somewhat like green tea with a slightly bitter taste."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Professor Amany Mohamed Basuny at Beni Suef University in Egypt wrote in a 2018 study published in Current Trends in Biomedical Engineering & Biosciences that olive leaf extract contains quadruple the dose of vitamin C and double the antioxidant levels of green <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">tea</span></a> – and could even help prevent <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">cancer</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He writes that the polyphenols found in olive leaves play an important role in preventing diseases associated with oxidative stress, for example cancer, Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular disease.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/28/29f452be-fea7-4ee6-bd44-18128fe5369e_fdff4326.jpg>“Several reports have shown that olive leaves have antioxidant activity, anti-HIV properties, anti-proliferative [cell growth suppression] and apoptotic effects [causing cancer cell death], and protective effect against human <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">leukaemia</span></a>.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Morović was in the fortunate position of having easy access to olive leaves, co-owning a 430-year-old olive grove with his wife, Nives. It is not just any olive grove. The trees and fruit in his ancestral grove, called Nai 3.3, have particularly high polyphenol levels.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The olive oil produced from them has won accolades in international competitions and health and nutrition awards for its polyphenol count, according to Morović.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">What is inflammation?

The grove has about 1,100 trees and is surrounded by five kilometres of dry stone wall built partly by Goran’s ancestors, who have lived there harvesting the olives for centuries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Morović took on the grove in 2009 and ran it as a small producer. In 2021 he and Nives went into hospitality, opening a luxury hotel called Villa Nai 3.3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/28/1822bbae-3243-45a6-82d2-9bc122117453_5f402276.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Set deep into the cool rock of the hillside, it also houses the olive mill. Within a year it has become a member of the Leading Hotels of the World. Part of its offering is to allow guests to come and help with the annual olive harvest in October.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Harvesting and preparation of the olives is painstaking, lasting for around three weeks. Five to 10 pickers collect an average total of 10,000 kilograms (22,000 lbs) of olives by hand; they must be picked while still green and just turning shiny.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Every day, the olives are pressed and the oil is stored in stainless steel barrels at a temperature of 16 to 18 degrees Celsius (61 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After a week or so, the oil is filtered to remove particles which would otherwise ferment. Then it is transferred into small bottles which are opaque to stop UV rays lowering the oil’s polyphenol count.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How eating a Mediterranean diet lowers your risk of Alzheimer’s</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cold-pressed, extra virgin olive oil is the most effective. Cold-pressed means the olives must be pressed at a temperature below 26 degrees Celsius without chemicals. If the temperature goes higher, some of the nutritional value is lost.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Morović adds that one of the most common myths about olive oil is that it can become toxic when heated to high temperatures. Although olive oil loses some nutritional value when heated, he says it is still the best oil to cook with.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His opinion is backed by a 2018 study which compared the oxidative stability of cooking oils, and found extra virgin olive oil remained the most stable when heated, closely followed by coconut oil.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We make the best French fries from olive oil that you will ever taste,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/28/ea28a1c3-1f46-4665-8346-676cec6e8146_a083618d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Guests who come to stay at Villa Nai truly work, eat and drink olive oil, in the form of daily shots and olive leaf tea. The spa uses olive oil in its treatments, including facials and body wraps. This is nothing new; Cleopatra was said to have bathed in olive oil as part of her beauty regime.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The olive branch has long been a symbol of peace.
