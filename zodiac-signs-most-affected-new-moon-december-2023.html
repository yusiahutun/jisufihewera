<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>4 Zodiac Signs Most Affected</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The lunar cycle is a journey that constantly ebbs and flows, but its story always begins with the new moon. And if you’re one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">zodiac signs most affected by the new moon</a>, you’re on the verge of making an important decision that has major ramifications for your future. However, if you know what type of energy you’re working with, it’ll be easier to put your best foot forward and maximize your success.</p><p>The most dramatic moments of the lunar cycle to happen at two different phases: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the new moon and the full moon</a>. While the full moon is always intense and climactic, the new moon is a more gentle nuanced experience, but that doesn’t make it any less important. In fact, the new moon is what kickstarts a whole chapter of your life, as it represents <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the start of something new</a>. For example: if you start a new relationship or begin the process of committing to a new project during a new moon, there’s a good chance it will reach completion by the time the corresponding full moon takes place six months later. All the emotions and turning points that tend to occur during a new moon are often incredibly telling, revealing all that is in store for you next.</p><p>When a new moon takes place, keep in mind that beginnings can feel just as terrifying as endings often feel complicated and bittersweet. If you’re currently feeling intimidated by what the future holds, ground yourself in the present moment and take things one step at a time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-5.png><p>Taking place on December 12 at 6:32 p.m. ET, the upcoming new moon takes place in open-minded, adventurous, truth-seeking, and philosophical Sagittarius, encouraging you to rethink your perspective and the beliefs that guide you forward through life. Because Sagittarius is ruled by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jupiter—planet of growth and grandiose thinking</a>—this new moon may feel like a big splash in your life. And because Jupiter is currently moving through Taurus—a zodiac sign that’s concerned with money and stability—it’s also a great time to set meaningful financial goals and to concentrate your energy on attracting abundance.</p><p>Although Sagittarius is generally a positive and optimistic fire sign, this new moon may bring up intense emotions and feelings of uncertainty. After all, this new moon is also squaring off <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with Neptune—planet of fantasies and distortion</a>—which could leave you feeling fearful and sensitive to the idea of the unknown. And because Mercury is just one day away from stationing retrograde, there’s a good chance you’ll have to take a few steps backward before you can truly move forward. Once again, you’ll have to take things one day at a time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=these-zodiac-signs-will-feel-the-new-moon-the-most>These Zodiac Signs Will Feel the New Moon the Most</h2><p>If your&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sun sign</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>moon sign</a>&nbsp;or—most importantly—your&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a>&nbsp;falls under any of the following zodiac signs, the upcoming new moon in Sagittarius could signify a meaningful turning point in your life. Here’s why:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.3033866415804><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>Get ready for meaningful relationship developments to unfold, as this new moon takes place in your seventh house of allies and enemies. You may be gearing up to enter a partnership with someone new or to embrace changes in a preexisting relationship.</p><p>However, because this new moon is also squaring off with Neptune in your 10th house of publicity, there’s a decent chance that this new moon may bring a rivalry into your life, especially at work. If you find yourself competing against someone, be extra cautious of who you put your trust in, as not everyone has your best interests at heart. With Mercury—your ruling planet—stationing retrograde on December 13, there is still unfinished business from your past that must be settled before you can truly move forward with this new beginning. As Mercury retrogrades through your eighth house of intimacy and transactions, keep in mind that you’re getting ready to settle debts that still linger from your past. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.8237476808905><h2>Virgo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Virgo.png><p>You’re learning so much about your heart under this new moon, as it takes place in your fourth house of home and private matters. Use this to your advantage by cleaning out the clutter in your personal space and spending time nurturing your emotional sense of self. Pay attention to the news that unfolds among your family and at home, as it will guide you toward making the right decisions for your sense of security.</p><p>However, as this new moon squares off with Neptune in your seventh house of allies and enemies, you may be unsure of where you stand with someone in your life. Be extra considerate of who you choose to trust and how you address the issues, as dancing around the facts will allow paranoia to proliferate. Stick to the facts! Because Mercury will station retrograde in your fifth house of romance one day after this new moon, there’s a good chance you may hear from an old flame during this new moon. The way you respond could make all the difference in the world. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.2902494331066><h2>Sagittarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sagittarius.png><p>You’re embracing a new era when it comes to your identity, as this new moon takes place in your first house of the self, launching a chapter in your life that contains major significance. You may be in the process of taking your first steps toward something that changes your whole perception of yourself. When you look in the mirror, you’re not just seeing the person you’ve been, but the person you can become. Chances are, you can already feel the start of this new story beginning to take hold of you.</p><p>However, because this new moon is squaring off with Neptune in your fourth house of home, family, and close friends, you may feel like a fish out of water as you take on this new persona. You may also feel concerned about how this change affects those closest to you, as the way you choose to break the news to others and communicate your needs will make all the difference. Don’t let the fear hold you back from the commitments you’re making to yourself. As Mercury is gearing up to station retrograde in your second house of values and finances, you’re still working out what you need in order to feel stable and confident in this decision. Don’t be afraid to negotiate and fight for what you deserve.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.2776911076443><h2>Pisces</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Pisces.png><p>Do you feel as though you’ve been falling behind on the tasks and feeling side-tracked from your true goals? Not to worry, because this new moon arrives right in time for you to let go of pipe dreams and take back control of your brand. As this new moon unfolds in your 10th house of career and authority, you’re feeling emboldened to make moves that align with your professional ambitions. It may be time to make an announcement on social media or to accept a promotion that you’re being offered.</p><p>However, because this new moon squares off with Neptune in Pisces, you may feel somewhat unsure of whether this next step is truly the right one to take. Don’t overthink it, because deep down, you know what you really want. No decision is without its caveats, so refuse to allow the “ifs, ands, or buts” to confuse your resolve when it comes to going after what you really want to achieve. Don’t forget that Mercury is just one day away from stationing retrograde in your third house of communication, which could resurrect conversations from the past that were previously left on “read”. More information is yet to come, which will make this decision much easier to make. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbrnOrKtmmZabsqTAxJ1kp52nYrqwu81mm56blaKvpr6Ma2dra18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gordon-ramsay-betrayed-says-hells-kitchen-winner-holli-ugalde-savoy-job-html.html><span>←</span><span>'Gordon Ramsay betrayed me' says Hell's Kitchen winner Holli Ugalde over Savoy job</span></a>
