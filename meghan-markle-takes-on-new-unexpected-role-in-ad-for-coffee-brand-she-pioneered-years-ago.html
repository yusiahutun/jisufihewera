The Duchess of Sussex invested in the brand Clevr back in 2202; her first investment to be made public.</strong></p><p>The 42-year-old former actress appeared in a social media promo clip for the coffee brand Clevr Blends, sending royal fans into a frenzy. <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> deleted all of her social media accounts back in 2018 before marrying <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>. However, she did not start her accounts back up even after leaving the royal family a few years later. As a result, an <a href=#>Instagram</a> video is the last place royal fans expected her to appear, although that is exactly what’s happened.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-950985408-1-1024x683.jpg><p>The Duchess made a few not-so-sneaky appearances in the latest Clevr Blends Instagram video. The clip sees the brand’s co-founder, Hannah Mendoza, taking fans and customers to the Clevr Blends headquarters and showing their team.</p><p>“I wanna give a huge shoutout to our Clevr team here at HQ. Without them we are nothing. Our fulfillment crew, lovingly packing your lattes,” she says, as Meghan appears in the background. The founder then introduces fans to the company’s digital team.</p><p>Once again we spot Meghan, this time working in an office-like setting. In another clip, Mendoza says “Finally the glue that literally holds us all together,” as Meghan is seen bent down near the refrigerator. She even hands out a drink to Mendoza. In the final clip, we see Meghan walk right in front of the camera as she tries to give a failed fist bump to a Clevr Blends employee. The two of them end up laughing out loud after their fail.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-duchess-of-sussex-was-the-first-investor-in-clevr>Duchess of Sussex was the first investor in Clevr</h2><p>For the unversed, Meghan was the first investor of Clevr Coffee. The brand’s co-founder Mendoza narrates this story in another Instagram video.</p><p>“This is how our small business went from this to this,” she says, showing the beginning stages of their company, then the second clip with Mendoza talking to Meghan as she shows her around their warehouse. She also talked about how Meghan invests in their lattes that help with “energy, stress and sleep.”</p><p>Mendoza explains that, three years ago, “everything changed.”</p><p>“None other than Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, had started drinking our lattes,” she recalls. The mother of two loved the product and also wanted to support a woman-led endeavor that uses sustainable sourcing.</p><p>“Meghan ended up becoming our first investor, advisor, and biggest Clevr advocate,” Mendoza says. The brand’s founder then recalls how Meghan also sent a few packages of Clevr to her billionaire neighbor Oprah Winfrey. A few days later, Oprah posted a video of herself making the coffee.</p><p><a href=#>Prince Harry</a>‘s wife announced her investment in Clevr back in 2022. “I’m proud to invest in Hannah’s commitment to sourcing ethical ingredients and creating a product that I love and [that] has a holistic approach to wellness. I believe in her, and I believe in her company,” she said at the time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-is-reportedly-building-a-wellness-brand-the-tig>Meghan is reportedly building a wellness brand – The Tig</h2><p>For those who don’t know, before marrying into the British royal family, Meghan wasn’t just an actress but also a lifestyle blogger. She ran a blog named The Tig, which was extremely popular among her fans.</p><p>Over the past few months, rumors that Meghan is looking to launch a wellness brand named The Tig have been swirling. The brand is said to have been inspired by Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop, which is famous for its sold-out This Smells Like My Vagina candle.</p><p>The rumor that Meghan filed for a patent for The Tig in 2022 also became widespread. The United States Patent And Trademark Office records show Frim Fram Inc. filed a patent on February 25, 2022. This is the same company that ran the site before its closure.</p><p>However, the Duchess has not commented on any of the above rumors.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2d9cLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55krZmbmsBuu81mpZ6vXaq7psTPnpqtnZRiv7C4xGagp2WRmXqnu9Fmmqielpqybq7RmqWdZaOdsm68yKilnp2imrFuxcSaqaxlkZy8cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./worlds-top-chefs-say-these-are-their-favourite-cheeses.html><span>←</span><span>Worlds top chefs say these are their favourite cheeses</span></a>
