His boyfriend's father catches the couple in bed and he's bullied in the locker room while dealing with suicidal thoughts that arise after questioning his worth in society.</p><p>"I'm not here to get my agenda over. I'm literally fighting for the equality of every man, woman and child regardless of race, religion, color, creed and sexual orientation and here to spread a message of peace, love and positivity," Logic said. "If you don't agree with it or you don't like it, that's fine, but you don't have to bash those people. It's the same reason why they feel like taking their lives. Just respect them and let them live their lives."</p><p>"You might not agree with someone's way of life or their religion or their this or that or whatever the case may be, but we don't have to kill each other over it," the rapper continued. "If you're right than be right. There's no need to hurt others."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b1e993b6-67d0-5a8a-ba5a-50743e506bf1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:39489eb9-af47-56e0-9189-f9b59525584b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0f/5by4/2017/08/17/0f7c0581ac635e9cb5c02696c8f5c637_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Watch Don Cheadle, Matthew Modine Star as Dads of Gay Teen Boyfiends in Logic's Powerful LGBTQ Video</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>TooFab <a href=#>exclusively spoke to Gould and Stewart</a> the day the music video dropped, and they were both felt the message was particularly timely due to the current political climate in America.</p><p>"With everything happening under the Trump administration, the LGBT community needs to see this video, learn about the hotline and know that there are people that care about them.

"So that's something I was struggling with because it was pretty easy for me to take on the emotional scenes and the suicide scenes because I understood, once I put myself in that mind state, how scary it can be to be alive in this world when you have so many people in this world who condemning you for just being who you are.
