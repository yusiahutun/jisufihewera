But from the moment the play-on music started at Raymond James Stadium, it hit every single member of my road family in the heart: the power of these songs and what happens when we play these songs for people.”</p><p>Having played to 1.3 million fans on his&nbsp;HERE AND NOW 2022 Tour, he broke his personal best attendance at many of the 21 NFL stadiums he played, the tour release said.</p><p>The only country artist to make&nbsp;Billboard’s Top 10 Touring Acts of the past 25 years for the last 14, Chesney decided the band was too good to not take them out to some of the markets he played when he was becoming the high-energy entertainer he is today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2021/02/fd953fbe1cb944f98d2fb43f3274002c.jpg><p><br>“My band found a whole new gear last summer,” Chesney explained. “As somebody who lives to play music, to feel that energy from No Shoes Nation and see what it does to all of us on that stage, I wanted everyone who’s loved this music to have a chance to experience what we were getting all summer, every single show. I remember that same vibe when this whole thing started taking off: people using chain-cutters to get onto the lawn in the Carolina amphitheaters ‘cause we were so sold out… switchboards crashing in Atlanta… the crazy night we had…<br>&nbsp;<br>“All those songs that time-stamped people’s lives, I want to make sure those people and those songs don’t get lost. It’s why we named this the&nbsp;I Go Back 2023 Tour. To me, to be able to share this band that’s so white hot – even our rehearsals have inspired all of us almost like the shows – with the fans who were there when this was turning into something great, that makes me even more fired up to get out there.”</p><p>Tickets for the Vibrant Arena concert are $53 to $153, <a href=#>available HERE</a>.
