Besides gaining fame as a popular wife, she is also a well-known published writer. Her most popular novel is ‘The Very Hairy But Not So Frightening Mouse,’ a children’s book. We’re going to talk more about it later.</p><h2><span id=Tabea_Pfendsack_and_Joe_Thornton-The_Married_Life>Tabea Pfendsack and Joe Thornton-The Married Life</span></h2><p>As we know, Tabea is best known in the media as the wife of Joe Thornton, a Canadian professional ice hockey player. So, how did Joe meet in the first place from Canada and Tabea from Switzerland?</p><p>We’ve got to go back to 2004 to learn about it. The pair met in Switzerland for the first time when Joe was at NHL Lockout. They began to get closer as soon as Joe started to visit the Tabea-run bar regularly. Not to mention that they immediately clicked and began dating. After dating for four years, the pair eventually tied the knot on June 26, 2009. Of note, the wedding ceremony was held in her home town of Switzerland. However, there are not many specifics about their wedding, apart from some wedding photos. They have two adorable children together. Their first child, Alya’s daughter, was born on July 14, 2010, while River’s son was born on June 6, 2013. The couple kept the media and the limelight away from their children.</p><p>While it’s been ten years since their union, the two have remained well away from speculation and accusations. Still, they have no plans to get divorced anytime soon.</p><h2><span id=Early_Lives_Family_and_Education>Early Lives, Family and Education</span></h2><p>A wife of Joe Thornton and a published author, Tabea Pfendsack was born in Switzerland. Unfortunately, not much of the beautiful Tabea is seen. Like who her parents were, and where she grew up.</p><p>As well as the specifics of her siblings are not found, it makes us wonder if she is the only child of her parents. We’ll update you on this shortly. Another thing we don’t know about is her schooling. While her academic credentials have not been published, we are confident that she holds a degree. Since Tabea is a writer and a businesswoman, it just seemed clear. Similarly, Tabea is Swiss by birth but retains Canadian citizenship since her marriage to Joe Thornton. Her race is white, too.</p><h2><span id=How_old_is_Tabea_Pfandsack_-Measurements_of_age_and_body>How old is Tabea Pfandsack? -Measurements of age and body</span></h2><p>Her early life and family are not the only thing we don’t know about Tabea Pfendsack. Apart from that, some personal details is still undisclosed. We don’t know when she was born on this date. The exact time is unusual.</p><p>Still, we say she’s in the 40s. Likewise, Pfandsack is a beautiful lady who has a great body. Unfortunately, even their dimensions, including height and other body measurements, are uncertain.</p><p>In addition, Pfendsack has long blond hair and a beautiful pair of blue eyes.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Career-Writer_Tabea_Pfendsack>Professional Career-Writer Tabea Pfendsack</span></h2><p>The popular woman, who is not a new name among the foundoms of ice hockey, is a talented lady on her own. She is a Swiss publisher and is currently engaged as a business professional as well. As a novelist, Tabea aims to touch the hearts of her young fans with her novels, how limited the demographics are. Likewise, one of her popular novels, for which she is well known, is ‘The Very Hairy But Not So Frightening.’For this children’s book, Tabea has teamed up with another writer, Tim Fennema. Together, they created a book to help children appreciate, rather than fear the creatures that some children are afraid of.</p><h2><span id=How_much_does_Tabea_Pfendsack_Earn_get_-Net_Word_and_Revenue>How much does Tabea Pfendsack Earn get? -Net Word and Revenue</span></h2><p>Being the wife of a professional ice hockey player, there’s not anything you can do to overshadow that. Even though Tabea is a self-published journalist, her net worth and earnings have been kept under wraps so far.</p><p>At the same time, she shares her husband’s net worth of $60 million. Not to mention, all the earnings are attributed to his good career as an ice hockey player.</p><p>Moreover, in 2015, Joe earned about $6.75 million yearly as his salary. Also, his career earnings to this date amount to somewhere around $108 million.</p><p>Just recently, Thornton signed a 1-year contract of $2 million with the San Jose Sharks; $2 million in guaranteed and another $2 million as an annual income.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_Tabea_Pfendsacks_Husband_Joe_Thornton>Who Is Tabea Pfendsack’s Husband Joe Thornton?</span></h2><p>By now, we all know that Tabea is the wife of Joe Thornton, a professional ice hockey player.
