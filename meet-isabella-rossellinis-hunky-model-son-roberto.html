And though Rossellini junior is Isabella’s adopted son, the two are inseparable. Nowadays, the mum-and-son duo work on their farm in Brookhaven, New York, which is also a bed and breakfast. It’s called Mama Farm and Isabella’s daughter Elettra Rossellini Wiedemann oversees the operations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But what else do we know about him besides his famous family?</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">The reinvention of Heart Evangelista, from teen actress to global fashion icon</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Roberto Rossellini was scouted on the streets of New York</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/17/d3f14540-a927-4432-b6e5-4771ad2b5435_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Standing at 190.5cm and with arresting green eyes, this Italian-turned-New Yorker (he has been living in New York since he was 11 years old), was scouted on the streets of Soho while walking with his girlfriend, filmmaker Kirsten Tanjutco.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/17/118406b5-f013-4c8a-99a8-97092aa5f5a0_8a66ae79.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As per Coveteur, the photographer who scouted him offered him a modelling gig for L’Officiel Italia. After the shoot, his mum suggested that he go to Ford Models and try his hand at modelling. He was signed on the spot. Though modelling wasn’t the job he had in mind, Isabella convinced him that it was great for networking and learning more about photography – which is what he wanted to do.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Inside Kris Jenner’s multimillion dollar property empire</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">He is usually the one behind the camera</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/17/3bfb0dd2-ee20-482a-ac75-308eb9733b51_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Growing up, he was surrounded by cameras, as his mum took him along wherever she was filming, from the US to all over Europe. This is also the reason he is multilingual – he picked up French and Spanish during these times, apart from his native Italian tongue and English, as per W magazine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/17/59691395-e93d-47cb-a668-7aa3ad22b4c4_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the same interview, he said that he finished a degree in cinematography at the International Center of Photography in New York. But it wasn’t until after he spent two years as a marine biologist undergrad at Stony Brook University that he gravitated towards studying the craft. He merged these two studies – marine biology and cinematography – when he went to the Bahamas to learn underwater photography for four months. After he graduated, he got a job as a photographer and editor at BFA. He frequently shares his work on Instagram.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is Devon Diep, the surprise new cast member of Bling Empire season three?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">He is the co-founder of Control Plus, a unisex clothing brand</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/17/b6b29007-d303-4796-a4e8-66435af3e12c_3a43d8b2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Combine photography, fashion, marine biology, underwater cinematography, dogs, and anime, and the result is Control Plus. It is a unisex clothing line combined with an NFT project, featuring minted characters that can also be bought as toy robots. The project is the brainchild of Rossellini and his girlfriend Tanjutco.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/17/075023dd-277c-46f3-8771-d6434b28e0ad_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They describe it as a cross between fashion and technology, with 10 per cent of the sales going to Korean K9 Rescue, a non-profit dog rescue organisation with headquarters in New York and South Korea.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is House of the Dragon’s Ty Tennant, son of Doctor Who’s David Tennant?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">He’s a dog and anime lover</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/17/31490db6-118d-4de3-9d87-53b95cb71f4d_58c45dfc.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is a reason why some of Control Plus’ proceeds go to a dog rescue organisation – Rossellini is a dog lover.

At one point, Roberto was having such a difficult time in New York City that they packed up and left to find greener pastures – literally. He lived on the farm until he finished high school, then moved back to the city because of work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/17/f5aaf6db-c068-49f2-af40-8539a661970a_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the same interview, he said how much he learned from living the simple life: “Growing up here with my mum, surrounded by nature and animals almost every day, had a significant impact on my life and taught me a lot about self-sufficiency and how we as human beings are not detached but an essential part of nature.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxocm5hbIBwucSeq2aho5avprjLmmSrp6Oosq24yKegrGWYqrusxYympp2dnGLAsLqMq6abnaKpvA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeff-glor-bio-salary-net-worth-wife-parents-height.html><span>←</span><span>Jeff Glor Bio, Salary, Net Worth, Wife, Parents &amp;amp; Height</span></a>
