They’re really bad… By and large, they’re all a little too shallow." Looking at Priya's bake, who placed last in the challenge, he said: "What? I’m not even going to look at that one." Even Steph, who came out on top, wasn't overwhelmed with praise, as Paul's fellow judge Prue Leith said: "I wish I could say they were the best Maids of Honour I'd ever eaten. But they were certainly the best of these lot. Well done."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/18eb5b00fcdb-paul-hollywood-1-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=efWVGfLGU8bFj data-wc=10><strong>What do you think about the new group of bakers?</strong></p><p id=ekrXZ7kQVWzsB data-wc=46>Fans were quick to discuss the bad bakes, with one writing: "When everyone's technical bake is THAT BAD that Paul Hollywood looked like he was ready to leave the tent himself," while another added: "Paul is being so mean this week you'd think he's lactose intolerant."</p><p id=eD6ufZL4bYqi- data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Great British Bake Off: Where are your fan favourites now?</a></strong></p><p id=eRyqqRqLZiE1X data-wc=82>Fans were also unhappy with the decision to send Phil home, with one person writing: "I am actually disgusted by the result tonight, Priya who came last in technical and didn't do that well in other two challenges goes through and Phil who has one slightly disappointing showstopper (but did well in other bakes) goes out." Another person added: "Michael couldn’t get his cake out of the tin, Priya failed miserably in the technical yet it’s Phil who has been set home?!?!"</p><p id=e07SychnNvHA7 data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Former GBBO finalist Ruby Bhogal reveals backstage secrets about the show</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
