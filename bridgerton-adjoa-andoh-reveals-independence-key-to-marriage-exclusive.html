Can you go and have adventures together? Can you cope with tragedy together? Can you do silly dancing together? All of that stuff, that stuff is important."</p><p id=eWD4ohLZYyht data-wc=101>Ultimately, Adjoa hopes women remember that "we are here for the blink of an eye," and that "it's a miracle that we exist as a species." She declared: "Dive into the 'mind-blowingness' of your life. And don't get caught up in stuff that you don't have the power to change… &nbsp;Lean into people who are marvelous and love you and want to have something to do with you. Change the stuff you can change about attitudes, but if they can't change it, move on, because life is short and glorious, and you need to be right in the heart of it."</p><p id=eWDJCqR41Ih data-wc=32></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
