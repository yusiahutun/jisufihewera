That’s just one of the many reasons why we love her. Here, she shares her tips for keeping a grateful heart and filling every day with lasting health, joy, and hope.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Throw-in-a-bag snacks satisfy cravings.</h2><p>“I try not to overdo it on snacks, but I’ll admit, I love lime Tostitos,” Hoda reveals. “I try hard to start my day with healthy options by putting <a href=#>fruit and veggies</a> in my bag every morning. The other things I throw in my bag are a yogurt, ginger chews, and Chex Mix. It’s gives just the right amount of crunch!”</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>On-the-go body oil is a secret weapon.</h2><p>“Bio-Oil is my favorite moisturizer,” Hoda declares. “It’s $10 to $15, depending on the size, and I put it everywhere — I even run a little through my hair. It is my go-to for everything!” <strong>Try</strong>: Bio-Oil Skincare Oil (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from CVS, $13.99</a>)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lemon-ginger tea boosts energy.</h2><p>“Every morning, I make a <a href=#>lemon-ginger tea</a> with a bunch of real lemons squeezed in it and a ginger cube — those frozen ones they have at Trader Joe’s,” Hoda describes. “They’re sold in a tiny ice tray, and each one has a ginger cube in it. I just pop it in with hot water, and before I start my day, I’ll drink that or pour it over ice. I don’t know what it does, but it makes me feel alive, great, clearer!” Why? Lemon juice is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, which boost immunity and metabolism, while zinc in ginger plays a prime role in insulin production, keeping your blood sugar stable!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Creating space is a stress Rx.</h2><p>“In life, I think we tend to crowd ourselves with so much stuff,” Hoda explains. “It’s like, sometimes when there is so much beautiful furniture in a room, you don’t really see any of it because it’s too stuffed. That’s what we do to our lives. We crowd them tight and then we’re like, ‘Well, I can’t see the beauty here.’ It’s almost like you have to clear it all out. Take things out. Make space. I think life is all about what you put on your plate and what you take off of it—and all that beauty that’s waiting for you just on the other side.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Love-able exercise melts a menopot.</h2><p>“The thing I have to do each day is exercise, whether it’s a walk in Central Park or a workout,” Hoda enthuses. “I do ‘Sundays with Love’ spin bike classes, which are exercise but with an inspirational element thrown in. They make me feel strong, connected and alive! And I like being outside. When you’re in a gym, it doesn’t have the same effect. But <a href=#>being outside</a> and seeing life — it feeds the soul and the body!” In fact, <a href=# rel=noopener>studies show</a> that access to sunlight while exercising enhances energy generation in the muscles and can boost self-esteem in as little as five minutes.</p><p>This content is not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.
