She is now a nutritional therapist, functional medicine practitioner and integrative cancer coach providing support to cancer patients.</p>Bertram says her biggest fear was not the cancer itself, but the toxic effects of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">chemotherapy and radiotherapy</span></a> that her oncologists had recommended. Rather than doing any more harm to the body she was working to heal “after a decade of debauchery”, Bertram looked to more natural, holistic treatments.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">My husband’s love and support helped me fight brain cancer</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She turned to a book a friend had given her, David Servan-Schreiber’s Anticancer: A New Way of Life. The author, a French neuroscientist, had discovered a tumour in his own brain at the age of 31. The book details the holistic treatment programme that he used to heal himself after his cancer diagnosis.</p>“Servan-Schreiber explains how we can inhibit the growth of cancer cells by <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">making changes in our diet</span></a>, lifestyle and managing our stress levels,” explains Bertram, who chose to combine conventional and alternative therapies.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She undertook six weeks of radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by another six weeks of oral chemotherapy. At the same time, she sought out natural treatments and consulted LifeClinic, an integrative health and medical clinic specialising in cancer care in Hong Kong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/07/30/e4f4ced5-8bf6-45f5-93ff-efd568ac5177_30a597ac.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Functional medicine practitioner and clinical nutritionist Miles Price introduced Bertram to a holistic approach to cancer care, which entails four tiers: diet, supplements, detoxification and emotional support.</p>“Our goal is to find out what’s causing the cancer using the functional medicine principles that focus on nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, toxicities and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">gut health</span></a>. By identifying the causes, we can keep the cancer from progressing,” says Price.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bertram followed a radical anticancer diet, supplemented with vitamin D tablets and intravenous vitamin C therapy to boost her immunity.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How the brain works and how to keep it healthier for longer</span></p></a></h3>“An anticancer diet is highly nutrient-dense, low-carb and supports organ regeneration. Nutrient-dense foods give the patients what they need to replenish, low-carb helps to keep the insulin levels low, which is important, as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">insulin drives cancer growth</span></a>,” Price says.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bertram also had infrared sauna therapy and coffee enemas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Infrared saunas relax the body, reduce stress and improve the immune response. Coffee enemas increases the rate of liver detoxification, which is important, as the liver’s job is to detoxify and rid the body of dead cancer cells,” explains Price.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/07/30/733fe532-cbe9-4e2f-b486-dd1e49970b59_fc2457ad.jpg>“I believe that cancer is an imbalance between the mind and body. It is not simply a tumour in the body,” says B<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">ertram who started practising meditation</span></a>, using the emotional freedom technique (or EFT), tapping the body on meridian points to ease physical pain and emotional distress, and daily affirmations – repeating phrases such as “I am healthy, I am healing” to aid in recovery.“I practised visualisation during my radiotherapy treatment. I imagined rays of light killing my cancer cells and I could see my cells becoming <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">healthy, happy and dancing with joy</span></a>,” says Bertram, who also practised restorative yoga and cardio training, including power walking, jogging and stair climbing, to become fitter.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Yoga helped me slow down, focus my thoughts on my breath and stay rooted in the present moment,” she says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Yoga, wigs and qigong: charity helps Hong Kong cancer sufferers</span></p></a></h3>“The mental and psychological side of living with cancer was my biggest challenge. The general prognosis for my cancer is typically not more than two years, and five years if you are lucky,” says Bertram, who was able to face her fears because of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">support she received from friends and family</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bertram also joined the Cancer Fund’s support group in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was paired with another person who was undergoing treatment for brain cancer. Meeting her and sharing our experiences leading up to our diagnoses and treatments made me feel that I was not alone in my struggle,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/07/30/b88ed048-ce5e-4ccb-8725-9de91d062484_f056cdfe.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bertram did not have many side effects from the chemotherapy and the radiotherapy, which she attributes to the benefits of her holistic treatments. She was inspired to become a nutritional therapist, specialising in supporting people with cancer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After four years of study at The Institute for Optimum Nutrition in London from 2016 to 2020 and apprenticeships with integrative medical doctors, she founded the Bertram Clinic of Nutrition in July 2020 in London. It supports people with chronic health issues including cancer, most of whom she consults online.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For me, cancer has been a gift, it has given me a second chance to live my life. I wake up every morning, feeling grateful and happy that I am healthy,” says Bertram.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She repeats a favourite quote: “We have two lives, and the second begins when we realise we only have one.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmxobWthZYFwuM6wZJyZopd6pbXErWSmnZSewaLAyKilZpmWm7azucCtoKimo2Kyt7HRsmSdmalitaa4z56b</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beetlejuice.html><span>←</span><span>Beetlejuice</span></a>
