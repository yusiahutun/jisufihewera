Until a couple of days ago I didn’t know this was happening … Ippei has stolen money from my account and told lies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m very saddened and shocked that someone who I trusted has done this,” Ohtani said of the allegations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ohtani said the first time he became aware of Mizuhara’s gambling problem was when the interpreter addressed the Dodgers locker room – in English – after their win over the Padres in South Korea last Wednesday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The two men had a one-to-one meeting at the team hotel after addressing the locker room, in which Mizuhara allegedly admitted he had been raiding Ohtani’s bank account without his knowledge to settle gambling debts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was revealed to me during that meeting, Ippei admitted he was sending money using my account to the bookmaker,” Ohtani said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“To summarise how I’m feeling right now: I’m just beyond shocked. It’s really hard to verbalise how I’m feeling at this point.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Major League Baseball on Friday announced it had launched a formal investigation into the allegations which have rocked the sport as it gears up for the new season.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">MLB is expected to request interviews with all parties, including Ohtani and Mizuhara, although officials cannot compel Mizuhara’s cooperation because he no longer works in the major leagues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m going to let my lawyers handle this from here on out and I am completely assisting in all investigations that are taking place right now,” Ohtani said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqKyYmr9uv8%2Boqa1nkafBqq%2FLnmZsamVrhHF9jqWYZpyfmbSmvtJmqq2ZomLAqbvHnqBmp5iprq%2B1jJ2cp6GVqHqjsdOtoKefXZeutLHBmqOlZaOWsaWxzZ6bZquYpLCsscNmnauhlaOxbrXPqZyiZZ2ex7a0wKuYrHedpLG2uMR2q6ioj6jBsL7YX6egrKmlsn6%2F1Juqnpuknryv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./herizen-guardiola.html><span>←</span><span>Herizen Guardiola</span></a>
