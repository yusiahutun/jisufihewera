Or at least, I think it is women I am seeing – albeit in the form of blurred, jarring, layered shapes of flesh and fabric, with wide eyes slotted into a tangle of limbs, acrylic nails and smudges of lipstick blasted across the canvas. These extraordinary creations are the work of the contemporary artist Angela Santana.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I wanted to free myself,” she says, guiding me around the exhibition (her first UK solo show). “I’ve always been intrigued by the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a40249400/ashley-graham-postpartum-body-video/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="female body" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">female body</a>, but I realised I knew how a painting would look before I’d even finished it. I was being driven by this idea that has been so intrinsic in our heads, created by male artists painting female bodies. I wanted to break that up into something new.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Santana’s latest pieces are the result of seven years of work. They are a concerted attempt to wrench the male gaze from art; to forge a new way of viewing the female figure that feels more nuanced and representative. Although she tells me she doesn’t believe that any approach to art can, or should, be gendered, she admits actively engaging with the male-dominated history of the painted female body and attempting to unpick it. “So much of our idea of what a woman looks like is informed by a man’s view of her,” she says. “This is an attempt to ‘re-see’ her – I wanted to turn woman from object to subject, to take away her implied passivity and give her strength.”</p><img alt="angela santana" title="angela santana" width=1040 height=672 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/angela-santana-spearmint-success-2017-oil-on-canvas-51x77-5inch-1655731322.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">courtesy</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">How do you paint strength? One way, Santana notes, is to address the dynamic between muse and artist, depicting the true character of the figure as opposed to the artist-imposed view. “But that’s hard,” she acknowledges. “I’m trying to really be open and led by the process to see who she becomes. One way is to look at how far we can push the body away from the idea of what it should be and see if we can still read it as a body.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Santana achieves this beautifully in the way she works. Digital images of women are layered with oil paints, clustered together so that the result is almost a cubist, abstract rendering of the female form. “I layer and layer until something new emerges,” she tells me. “I like the contrast between the digital and the tactile oils, the hard and the soft, the otherworldliness and the earthiness. The pixelation helps with the idea that we are presenting many aspects of what makes up a woman – they still have a certain flux in them. Even though it is a static image, it keeps a sense of tension.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Each brushstroke, shape and composition headily conveys the mixed bag of implications and assumptions that are loaded on to the female form. Her choice of colours feels commercial and heavily sexualised, while also recalling bruises and smudged make-up. Shapes seem alluring and provocative, yet at the same time confident and defiant. The result is something that is both literally and metaphorically layered – Santana’s shrewd way of making her women untouchable.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The bodies she paints are composites of thousands of images, including many illicit ones of women online. Most of these, once again, are pictures taken to be pleasing and pliant, largely created by and for men. “Collecting all these photos was fascinating. It made me realise the volume and speed of our consumption of images of women online and how this props up male fantasy,” she says. “But I never wanted my pieces to be sensational. Representing women properly means embracing every facet of our life, erotic or otherwise. It’s about celebrating but reframing female sexuality.”</p><img alt="angela santana" title="angela santana" width=871 height=590 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/angela-santana-love-is-now-2016-oil-on-canvas-84x118in-214x300cm-1655731690.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">courtesy</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Santana’s work has frequently focused on bodies. The Zurich-born artist, who studied in Switzerland, currently lives and works in New York, and previously exhibited a few pieces from this series last year in ‘Bodypainted’, a group exhibition at Konstanze Wolter gallery in Germany. The show aimed to examine the messy contradictions of the body: sexual, nurturing, commodified, natural and enhanced. Santana’s work was, of course, a natural fit. “Women’s bodies have always attracted so much attention and discussion, and we make them these symbols of so much. That’s why they fascinate me,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Santana’s next projects will see her experiment with screen printing and etchings, as well as with both larger- and smaller-scale pieces, also designed to radically reframe the female form. Certainly, when you look around Saatchi Yates and see these unreadable, unidentifiable, unapologetic women stare back at you, you sense the power of this emerging artist’s ambition.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Angela Santana is at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://saatchiyates.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Saatchi Yates" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Saatchi Yates</a> until 31 August.</strong></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The making of the Dior Cruise 2023 collection" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dior-cruise-2023-1655458948.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSvosbAmqlmmaKpfKKAj2xrcnFobXyiusaeo5plo5a7ta3NmmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./british-teen-tennis-star-emma-raducanu-makes-history-grand.html><span>←</span><span>British teen tennis star Emma Raducanu makes history with Grand Slam title - YP</span></a>
