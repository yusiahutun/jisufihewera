Sure, those pieces still exist today, but the options available now are endless and dare we say comfortable while being no less alluring. That’s because more and more brands are designing with older women in mind and know that comfort and practicality are key. So if you’re in the market for a new lacy pair of panties or a silky night gown, you’ve come to the right place. Keep scrolling for the best lingerie for older women and how wearing it can be a big boon for your self-esteem.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why women over 50 should wear lingerie</h2><p>While you might think you’re too old for lingerie, think again. A good bra and panties are an essential foundation under any outfit, and lingerie not only looks great, but it can make you feel great too, say lingerie experts <a href=# rel=noopener>Noa Arias</a> and <a href=#>Shaula Yemini</a>, co-founders of women’s lingerie brand&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Bloomers Intimates</a>. “When women feel comfortable and pretty in their lingerie, they radiate confidence and sexiness,” says Yemini. Plus, there’s even psychological research that reveals <a href=# rel=noopener>how selecting the pair of underwear we wear can affect our mood</a>.</p><p>Even if lingerie isn’t showing, wearing it underneath our clothes can be a confidence booster. “It’s like a sexy little secret we keep under our ‘Clark Kent’ uniforms, waiting to break out and be the superwomen we are,” adds Yemini. And there are also plenty of options that can help boost confidence in the bedroom or make you feel good to even wear while snoozing.</p><p>Additionally, lingerie can actually provide shape and extra support for your assets, meaning pieces are no longer just for looks. That’s because the latest lingerie styles have built-in cups (without painful underwire!), shapewear, adjustable straps, velcro fastening and more that help older women feel comfortable showing off some skin.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the best lingerie for older women?</h2><ul class=number><li><strong>Best lingerie romper for older women : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Maille Plus Pajama Romper</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best lace panties for older women : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Spanx Undie-tectable Lace Hi-Hipster Panties</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best long lingerie nightgown for older women : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Flora Nikrooz Stella Gown</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best chemise for older women : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Jezebel Demure Knit Chemise</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best lingerie briefs for older women : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Bloomers Her Highness Briefs</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best teddy lingerie for older women : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Bare Necessities OH LÀ LÀ CHÉRI Aria Teddy</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best lingerie wrap : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">In Bloom by Jonquil Heartbreaker Wrapper</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best lingerie pajamas : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">In Bloom Felicity 2-Piece Satin Crop Pajama Set</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best adaptive lingerie bra : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Amoena Nancy Multi-Part Cup Lace-Trim Bra</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best adaptive lingerie panties : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">The Liberare Cheeky</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best plus size lingerie bra : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Lane Bryant Asymmetrical Lightly Lined Balconette Bra</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best plus size lingerie panties : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Lane Bryant Lace Wide-Side Thong</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best camisole lingerie for older women : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Bare Necessities The Smoothing Lace Cami</a></strong></li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Full coverage lingerie can still be sexy and comfortable</h2><p>Even though “our bodies change in so many subtle ways as we age,” notes Arias, there’s no need to sacrifice comfort or coverage when wearing or picking out lingerie. As we get older “we often want to hide these changes and start to gravitate towards full-coverage lingerie,” she says. Like trading “thongs for granny panties — but full coverage doesn’t have to mean big cotton granny panties,” she insists.</p><p>There are so many different materials to choose from that still give you full coverage, but look and feel a little more alluring than your regular cotton pair of panties. For instance, take silk or lace. Swapping out your old underwear for ones with these details automatically will make you feel more elevated, confident and sexy. And because these fabrics feel like a second skin, you’ll feel extra comfortable to boot.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The best lingerie for older women</h2><p>Here, a selection of bras, chemises, camisoles, panties and more that are not only flattering on older women but also comfortable and easy to put on (or take off).</p><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Maille Plus Pajama Romper</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>best lingerie romper for older women</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/full.jpeg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Adore Me, $59.95</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Has pretty lacy side panels</li><li>Comes in sizes XS-4X</li></ul><p>This self-tie, elastic-waist romper from Adore Me is sexy and romantic.
