Being proud of who you are is what Zoey Luna has taught us. She gained her fame after being cast in the lead role in “The Craft” and a few commercials as well. Being of Latin descent Zoey rose to fame while sharing her story through various mediums such as documentaries, interviews, and a few ad campaigns about her being a trans woman in America.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Zoey was born to Ofelia Barbra on the 23rd of July in the year 2001 in Downy, California. Zoey was a very energetic young child who loved to dance and sang around quite often. She was also a part of several school plays. Unfortunately, details about her education institutes are hard to come by.</p><h3>Zoey Luna Career</h3><p>Being transgender isn’t all that taboo in the fast-developing world. Zoey has had a documentary based on her which goes by the name “Raising Zoey”. This documentary was first premiered at Out Fest (quite ironic). The documentary is one of the most succinct and stirring of these chronicles. The film tells the story of Zoey Luna who was born as a boy but knew that her identity was that of a girl even before she entered school. Apart from this, she was cast as Lucy Van Pelt in the play “You’re a good man Charlie Brown”, and as Barbara Cole in the play “Night of the Living Dead”. This just shows how comfortable Zoey was being identified as a female. Her story was and still is being shared through a multitude of mediums which vary from documentaries to certain ad campaigns and even though a few interviews.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u21e16c6e66b803f83b49c590bd9d9172><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Chloe Rose Robertson Biography</span></a><p>A lot of people look up to Zoey because of her confidence. Her most recent work is in the short film “Boundless” which is directed by Rosario Dawson. This film is said to air on television for FX. Her character ‘Lourdes’, a transgender punk rocker in the movie “The Craft” was released in the month of October on the 28th in the year 2020. Her talent can be traced back to her childhood. While she was still in middle school, Zoey in pursuit of the thrill and passion of performing on stage became involved in various talent shows. She first started out as a singer and had her first taste of acting when she was in middle school and pursued it throughout high school (thankfully).</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Zoey Luna Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Zoey Luna</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>July 23, 2001</td></tr><tr><td>Age (As of 2022)</td><td>20 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Downy, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Leo</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Zoey-Luna-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 7” – </strong>in Centimetres <strong>– 170 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 70 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 154 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Average</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Ofelia Barba</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>Leticia Barba</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Zoey-Luna-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Who is her boyfriend?</td><td>–</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ue7c5e50a7c12a1bc390cd8554a87bea8><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Manuel Garcia-Rulfo Biography</span></a><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Be it, anybody, in a world like this a lot of us struggle with our own identities but this fine lady seems to be extremely comfortable in her own skin and she really deserves to get applauded for that. Zoey has been living the dream of ‘being comfortable in your own skin’ (not without facing her own struggles). Zoey is unapologetic and is a strong feminist. She’s been active in telling her story as a transgender, Latin woman.</p><p>This may sound cliché but Zoey claims to have known that she was trans from a very young age. We all have seen some pretty spine-chilling coming out videos but in the case of Zoey, her family was very accepting of the fact she felt this way and supported and encouraged her.</p><h3>Zoey Luna Net Worth</h3><p>Zoey is said to have a pretty good net worth of around $ 250 million. But as we all have heard being known for what you do is the most important hurdle in being a good and generous human and Zoey without a doubt is living up to that.</p><h3>Trivia</h3><ul><li>Luna is an American and belongs to the Latin ethnicity.</li><li>She was featured in the HBO docuseries 15: A Quinceañera Story.</li><li>Zoey firmly believes in standing up for LGBTQ+.</li><li>She loves reading and photography.</li><li>She plays the lead role in the reboot of “The Craft”.</li><li>Zoey can be found on Instagram where she has a following of 16.1k followers.</li></ul><span class=simplesocialtxt>Facebook</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Twitter</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Reddit</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>WhatsApp</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Pinterest</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZa5tbTYrKeyZpOkunDGzp6wZqSlo65w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lisa-germano.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Lisa Germano dating?
