However, the issue of self-scrolling has had a frustrating and disruptive impact on users. When this happens, you lose control as the app scrolls through its feed without your input. Luckily, it is possible to solve the self-scrolling problem on Facebook.</p><h2>Why is Facebook scrolling on its own?</h2><p class=align-left>Have you ever experienced Facebook, where it scrolls on its own? If so, there are many reasons why this could happen. Facebook scrolling on its own on iPad or any other device may be caused by several reasons, including:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f792e36449d26d3f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Instagram unable to load image from gallery: 5 fixes that work</span></p></a><h3>1. Software glitches or bugs</h3><p class=align-left>Like any other <a href=#>social media</a> platform, Facebook may experience technical glitches or bugs. These glitches may lead to auto-scrolling, making it look like the app is scrolling on its own.</p><p class=align-left>If you're using the Facebook mobile app, bugs and issues in the app's code could lead to auto-scrolling. This problem can occur on Android and iPhone devices, making your experience undesirable.</p><h3>2. Usage of data on the Facebook app's background</h3><p class=align-left>The scrolling issue on Facebook may also be caused by data usage in the background. Auto-play videos in your <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook feed </a>can sometimes cause the page to scroll automatically. This can happen when videos load or play without user interaction.</p><h3>3. Network issues</h3><p class=align-left>The problem of Facebook scrolling itself may also be caused by poor network issues. Slow or unstable internet connections can disrupt the loading of <a href=#>Facebook content</a>, leading to auto-scrolling.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0b09212675cfc38b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Google Messages Reactions not working: The 5 best fixes</span></p></a><h3>4. Outdated app version</h3><p class=align-left>Facebook periodically updates its user interface and adds new features. These updates can sometimes lead to unexpected behaviour, which may be perceived as auto-scrolling. The older versions may be infected with bugs or malware, causing the issue of self-scrolling.</p><h3>5. Corrupted cache data</h3><p class=align-left>Corrupted cache data refers to temporary files and data stored on your device or within an application to help it run more efficiently. These cached files can include images, text, scripts, and other resources the app or system uses frequently.</p><p class=align-left>When cache data becomes corrupted, it means that these files have become damaged or unusable, and they may cause issues with the functioning of the application or system like Facebook self-scrolling.</p><h3>6. Too much data</h3><p class=align-left>This problem makes the app scroll itself and may lead to Facebook scrolling slowly. If you have many friends, pages you follow, or groups you're a part of, your Facebook feed may contain much data.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1a9e2ef0db204055.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to fix This page isn't available right now on Facebook</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This data's constant retrieval and rendering can slow down the app's or website's performance, leading to laggy and sluggish scrolling.</p><h2>How to stop Facebook from self-scrolling</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f792e36449d26d3f.png><p class=align-left>By resolving the above issues, you can stop Facebook from auto scrolling on Android or iPad. Being that the Facebook app cuts across all devices, it is important to find out the exact problem of the app and fix it with the following instructions:</p><h3>1. Disable data saver on the Facebook app</h3><p class=align-left>Data saver settings typically reduce data usage by compressing and optimizing images and videos. In the process, it might lead to slower content loading or cause unexpected behaviours, like self-scrolling.</p><p class=align-left>Turning off the data saver allows the app to load and display content more conventionally, potentially eliminating the self-scrolling issue.</p><h3>2. Enable background app refresh</h3><p class=align-left>Enabling background app refresh can potentially help address self-scrolling issues in apps, including Facebook. When background app refresh is active, the app can periodically update its content and data in the background, ensuring it remains up-to-date without requiring user interaction.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/85d8d5fbaea928ee.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What the Page Not Found Instagram error means and how to fix it</span></p></a><h3>3. Clear browser cache</h3><p class=align-left>This is another troubleshooting step you can take when the <a href=#>Facebook page </a>is scrolling by itself. Various factors can cause self-scrolling, and one may be corrupted or outdated cached data that the browser uses to render the web page.</p><p class=align-left>Clearing the cache removes this potentially problematic data and forces the browser to reload a fresh one. The clean version of the webpage can help resolve issues like self-scrolling, especially when the cached data contains errors or conflicts.</p><p class=align-left>However, this method is primarily applicable if you are accessing Facebook through a web browser on your device or with devices other than your iPhone. For iPhone, you can only clear the Facebook app's cache by clearing the cookies collected by the app's mobile browser.</p><h3>4. Update the Facebook app</h3><p class=align-left>Updating the Facebook app when experiencing issues like self-scrolling is crucial because updates often include bug fixes and performance improvements. Developers routinely release updates to address known problems and enhance the app's stability.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/baea59ab1a2c4db3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why is my Instagram black? The reason and how to fix it</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Keeping your app up to date increases the likelihood of receiving these fixes, which can resolve issues like self-scrolling. Furthermore, outdated app versions are more likely to contain software glitches.</p><h3>5. Leave the Beta program on Facebook</h3><p class=align-left>Beta users essentially serve as testers, helping developers identify and rectify issues. By reverting to the stable version, you opt for a more reliable and smoother user experience. The stable version undergoes rigorous testing and is generally considered more stable and less prone to glitches, including self-scrolling problems.</p><h3>6. Uninstall any scrolling extensions</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0b09212675cfc38b.png><p class=align-left>Uninstalling scrolling extensions or related browser add-ons is recommended when the app is self-scrolling. Such extensions are designed to modify or enhance scrolling functionality within the web browser, and when their behaviour clashes with the app's, it can lead to erratic and unexpected scrolling.</p><h3>7. Reinstall the Facebook app</h3><p class=align-left>When you uninstall and then reinstall the app, you remove any corrupted or problematic data that may be causing the self-scrolling behaviour. It can also eliminate any issues that may have been introduced during app updates or installation processes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c5239e09503b4906.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why can't I post on Instagram? 6 ways to fix the problem</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Reinstalling the app ensures you have the latest version and can help reset any settings or configurations that might be contributing to the problem, offering a fresh start for a smoother and more stable Facebook experience.</p><h3>8. Use Facebook Lite</h3><p class=align-left>Using Facebook Lite can be beneficial when dealing with issues like self-scrolling in the standard Facebook app because <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook Lite</a> is designed to be more data-efficient and streamlined. Facebook Lite is also a lighter version of the main Facebook app.</p><p class=align-left>This means it consumes fewer system resources and is less likely to exhibit performance issues or glitches, such as self-scrolling.</p><h3>9. Reach out to Facebook support</h3><p class=align-left>You can reach out to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook technical support</a> for further troubleshooting issues if the problem persists. They may have specific solutions or be able to address any known issues with the app.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p class=align-left>The issue of why Facebook is scrolling on its own has solutions. You can choose a solution that applies to your issue from the list above. Some of these solutions cut across the board, such as updating the Facebook app, reinstalling the app or clearing the data cache.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4c6d89e392482194.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why is the KCB app not working?
