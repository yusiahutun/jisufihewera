Although he starred in Real Housewives of New York City (or simply <a href=#>RHONY</a>), what&nbsp;Jason&nbsp;is known for is his unending court battle with his wife.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Rocky Marriage</h2><p>Frankel&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hoppy&nbsp;married in 2010. Even though their amicable relationship has long ended in a tense 2014 court battle over&nbsp;Bryn’s&nbsp;custody agreement, they were technically still married in 2020.</p><p>Bethenny&nbsp;opened up about their strange arrangement to&nbsp;Andy Cohen&nbsp;during an episode of “Watch What Happens Live”, where she also disclosed that the ex-couple still shares an apartment.</p><p>According to one source, Bethenny’s&nbsp;lawyer&nbsp;Robert Wallack&nbsp;has so far objected to the conditions of the divorce settlement.</p><p>The former&nbsp;reality star&nbsp;couple has been in the limelight since the two had a horrible relationship, which apparently didn’t even end father their split, and a nasty custody&nbsp;battle over daughter&nbsp;Bryn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2021/03/hoppy-twitter.jpg><p id=ent-5>The&nbsp;drama&nbsp;escalated even further when in 2017,&nbsp;Hoppy&nbsp;allegedly taunted&nbsp;Frankel&nbsp;and late boyfriend&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dennis Shields</a>&nbsp;(Shields died from a drug overdose in August 2018) in front of&nbsp;Bryn’s&nbsp;classmates and their parents.</p><p id=ent-5>The resulting “order of protection” mandated Hoppy to keep away from the Housewife’s home, business, as well as their daughter’s&nbsp;school&nbsp;for 6 months.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from keeping the relationship with&nbsp;Frankel&nbsp;contentious, what else does&nbsp;Jason&nbsp;do? What does he do for a living? Well,&nbsp;stick&nbsp;around to find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Family and Education</h2><p>The 6′1″ hunk was born on September 10, 1970, in New York City to parents Carol A. Hoppy and Robert M. Hoppy.</p><p>He went to Scranton University in Pennsylvania and has a brother, Bryan Hoppy.</p><p>Although not much is known about the time between university and corporate career, Hoppy seemed to have planted himself firmly in the path of opportunity as a young professional.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Account Executive</h2><p>Going by his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">current LinkedIn profile</a>, Jason is (or was) an account executive at a pharmaceutical company called <i>AbbVie</i>.</p><p>There is no recent update about the listing, so it is hard to tell whether Hoppy is still with the company or this was a past job that he once held.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Past Income Streams</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Reality TV shows</h3><p>As aforementioned,&nbsp;Hoppy&nbsp;appeared on Bravo’s Reality TV show,&nbsp;RHONY&nbsp;(2010) and&nbsp;Bethenny&nbsp;Ever After (2010-2011). He was definitely paid handsomely, given that his ex-wife and star was paid around $40,000 per episode on the same shows.</p><p>Jason, on the other hand, ended up making $8.5 million between 2015 and 2016.</p><p>In addition,&nbsp;Frankel&nbsp;is also an author of several best-selling books such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Free Yourself from a Lifetime of Dieting, Naturally Thin: Unleash Your Skinnygirl</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Place of Yes</a> among others.</p><p>Being married to a rich spouse has proven to be a good way to stabilize and increase one’s income and net worth.</p><p>Given that&nbsp;Jason&nbsp;was married to&nbsp;Bethenny Frankel&nbsp;at the time when these best-selling books were a big hit, he must have benefited financially in one way during their marriage.</p><p>If he didn’t, then he surely deserved his share of the divorce settlement.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>A Pharmaceutical Sales Representative</h3><p>Hoppy had a thriving career as a sales representative for an established pharmaceutical company. He is reported to have earned a high commission as a sales representative.</p><p>That skill is what he used to launch his next business: a real estate agency.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Successful Real Estate Agent</h3><p>Before coming to New York, it is reported that&nbsp;Hoppy&nbsp;had a dream of becoming a top&nbsp;real estate agent&nbsp;and businessman.</p><p>He was apparently good enough in the business and managed to earn himself over $5 million.</p><p>Hoppy&nbsp;used the earnings to purchase a beautiful 5 million dollar home in New York. He had to sweat off the same home with his ex-wife over financial settlements.</p><p>Although&nbsp;Jason Hoppy&nbsp;has been portrayed in the press as some sort of a monster, following his notorious relationship and ultimately failed&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;to&nbsp;Bethenny Frankel, he is no doubt a successful business executive and real estate mogul.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCRqXqlu8SsZKOZo6S7brTOqaeyZZSkeqe70WaYZqSZq7avs44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pup-crawl-returns-to-downtown-stuart.html><span>←</span><span>Pup Crawl Returns to Downtown Stuart</span></a>
