He mentioned that<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/love-on-the-spectrum-us-showrunner-cian-oclery-interview rel=nofollow> he met a lot of people</a> who had autism while he was working with Love on the Spectrum co-executive producer Karina Holden. “Not only did we get to know the people we were filming really well, but we also spoke to hundreds and hundreds of people on the spectrum about their lives and what was important to them. The story of people wanting to<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1670569/how-many-married-at-first-sight-couples-still-together/> find love </a>and wanting to date just kept coming up. To us, that was something that wasn’t right. There was obviously a lack of support, and it just felt like a really interesting area to shine a light on.”</p><p>He continued, “The other thing that we noticed was the diversity of the spectrum and just how different people can be. That’s the most important thing that we can do with this series, to show that huge diversity that people don’t really understand. I should note, as well, it’s really important to acknowledge that not everybody who is on the spectrum needs support in the world of dating and relationships. Everyone’s so different. But a lot of people do, and <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lifestyle/love-sex/326978/things-people-in-strong-relationships-never-worry-about/>a lot of people</a> we spoke to did and were really calling out for that.”</p><p>A couple of familiar faces will be returning to the show for a second chance at love, and some new faces will make their debut.
