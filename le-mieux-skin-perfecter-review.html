There’s a decently sharp edge on the device’s stainless-steel “spatula,” which is intended to operate at 28,000 low-frequency ultrasonic vibrations per second to “tone” and “stimulate” the skin. You can also flip the spatula over so that it’s flat against the face to utilize the ultrasonic waves as a means of “accelerating the absorption” of serums, gels, and other water-based treatments post-cleansing.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ashley-review.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nuface.jpg><p>I didn’t use it that way, though, because what I’m really in it for is the gadget’s deep-cleansing abilities: One of its four supposed uses is as an extractor, working to push “imperfections” (read: dirt, makeup, and more of the gross shit that accumulates on our faces every day of our lives) out of the pores. My skin is relatively good right now, but I was really excited about using this mechanism on my nose, where my pores are a bit enlarged and frequently inhabited by … stuff. (A proper aesthetician&nbsp;would probably sell her&nbsp;soul to squeeze the gunk out, but I hate having strangers touch my face so I rely on self-inflicted measures.)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/home_content1.jpg alt=home_content1 width=585 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Your face has to be positively drenched in water for the Skin Perfecter to glide gently across the skin as it’s meant to, so I used <a href=#>micellar water</a>, a pH-balanced but definitely more expensive choice that’ll get the job done if you, too, fear tap water. This tool is meant to be used for three minutes about three times a week, but it doesn’t have a timer, so I just kept moving it around my face until I got bored. As I did this, I noticed a fair amount of what looked like grayish water accumulating on the spatula. This satisfied me and propelled me to continue, despite the fact that the vibrating metal felt really weird on my face. Not uncomfortable, just weird, like a strong tingling sensation.</p><p>I used the Skin Perfecter twice over the weekend, once on Friday evening and again on Sunday morning. Both times it left my face looking red and feeling warm, and both times it calmed down within an hour or so—not really a cause for concern. (I imagine this is a byproduct of my skin cells being “stimulated.”) And both times I noticed that the pores on my nose looked significantly clearer, as if I’d used a Biore strip.</p><p>Honestly, that was all I really wanted out of the deal—one only uses a Skin Perfecter if she&nbsp;wants perfect skin, after all. But I’m also finding that, after the redness and warmth wears away, my skin looks clearer and brighter, almost translucent. It’s pretty wonderful to have something that gives me practically facial-like results in my tiny bathroom, and because the device requires no brushes of any sort (you just wipe the spatula down with alcohol after each use), it’s pretty much as low-maintenance as an intensive beauty tool gets. Points all around.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWSCcYWYa2topJViuqqx1LFkrKOZo3qxsdGfnJyslad6s7HVopywZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./undervolt-ryzen-cpus-cycler.html><span>←</span><span>The Effortless Way to Undervolt Ryzen CPUs With CoreCycler for Windows</span></a>
