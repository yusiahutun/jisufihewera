December is always a stressful time at the management consultancy firm where I work, but this year, I’m even more exhausted than usual and feel as though I’m trying to do too much. I have three children and my partner takes charge of most family commitments – I’d like to be able to spend more time with them at home, but as the main household earner, I find it hard to cut back my working hours. I know that I need a better work-life balance for myself in 2024, but I don’t know where to start.</p><p>Yours gratefully,</p><p>Sarinda, 38</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Jo says...</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dear Sarinda,</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thanks for your email. It’s ironic that the holiday period is the only time of the year when most people get a break, and yet it’s never the kind of rest we really need to recharge us for the year ahead, especially if you have children.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling exhausted. You’re juggling a high-pressure job, a relationship and three children. So, let’s start by taking a step back and recognising that. Sadly, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/people-parties/bazaar-at-work/a43493291/burnout-signs-treatment-tips/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=burnout class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">burnout</a> is extremely common and can lead to medical leave if not addressed in time, so it makes sense that you’d like to make some positive changes to support your energy and give you a bit more family time going forward.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Master the Art: Leigh-Anne Pinnock on finding your voice" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hb-moa-thumb2-1628773726.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">From what you describe, you and your husband are doing a great job at ‘dividing and conquering’, with you as the main financial contributor, and your husband managing the family commitments. This ensures that your children’s needs are met, and the family operates efficiently. Is it perfect? No, it never really is, but at least you are demonstrating that you both work well as a team, and this is important when we are trying to create more <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/people-parties/bazaar-at-work/a41461873/how-to-balance-creativity-and-commerciality/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=balance class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">balance</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Work-life balance is, essentially, maintaining a harmonious relationship between your work and personal life by managing your time and energy to meet both professional and personal commitments. This is incredibly difficult to achieve most of the time, but there are things we can do to help us understand ourselves and our needs better. Remember, as parents, we have a duty of care to ourselves as much as we do to our children; it’s not a selfish act. Your health and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a26007940/breathing-therapy-wellness/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=wellbeing class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">wellbeing</a> are vital to theirs, so let’s look at what we can do.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1/ Plan your week as if it’s work</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It sounds crazy, but having a weekly operational meeting with your husband ensures that responsibilities are allocated and there are no surprises. It’s also when you can ask each other for help if you’re feeling more pressure that week; teamwork makes the dream work after all.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">2/ Create efficiencies</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As creatures of habit, many of us can become trapped by our daily routines, but there may be a better way to do things that can have incredible wellbeing results – looking at our routines around <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a43349252/world-sleep-day-sleep-business/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=sleep class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">sleep</a> can be a good place to start.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">3/ Prioritise your health</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Remind yourself what you need to feel energised and relaxed. Whether it’s exercise, more sleep, less alcohol, having baths, or phoning a friend – make a list of the things that you know make you feel better, because these often slip when we get busy. Make a commitment to re-introduce them as soon as possible.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">4/ List your happiness non-negotiables</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Happiness reduces stress, so focus on what you know you need. You mentioned more time at home; what does this realistically look like, and how could you make it work? There’s always a compromise to be found somewhere, and even tiny changes can have huge results.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">5/ Practise being present</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is easier said than done, but if you can try to be fully focused on each moment, your fulfilment will go up and your stress levels will go down. I find leaving my phone out of reach at home really helps me focus on family time, and I never look at my phone during the night – there’s not much I can do at 3am!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Let me know how you get on, and good luck,</p><img alt="jo glynn smith" title="Jo Glynn Smith" width=901 height=589 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2024-01-03-at-10-00-14-6595303a857ba.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Jo Glynn-Smith</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jo Glynn-Smith is a transformation coach, speaker and personal-brand expert from London who works with leaders, entrepreneurs and businesses to help maximise their team or individual potential.
