Naturally, Mint Velvet brought the same vibe to its newest clothing and accessories, releasing ruffled button-downs, eye-catching knits, and relaxed trousers as part of its <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>spring 2024 </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>drop</a>.</p><p>Ahead, we’re including our favorite Mint Velvet items, which you could no doubt wear and love now, but will also enjoy rocking months down the road. If your fashion goals include comfort, versatility, and small touches that make each item feel special, these pieces are definitely for you.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.83456790123457><h2>Pink Ruffle Detail Shirt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mint-Velvet-Pink-Ruffle-Detail-Shirt.jpg><p>When we said our closet could use a boost, we meant it. This <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>pink ruffled shirt</a> is right in line with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>top trends of 2024</a>, and since it’s already a statement piece, it won’t require much else to create a standout outfit. Wear it with your favorite pair of jeans for an easy yet fashion-forward look.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.82505910165485><h2>Navy Longline Scarf Coat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mint-Velvet-Navy-Longline-Scarf-Coat.jpg><p>We’re already big fans of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">scarf coat trend</a>, and if you’re in the market for outerwear that will keep you warm but isn’t as boring as a bulky puffer, this design is it. We’re especially fond of the white trim included in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mint Velvet’s navy option</a>, which makes it look way more expensive than its $409 price tag.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.3707983193277><h2>Taupe Denim Jumpsuit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Taupe-Denim-Jumpsuit.jpeg><p>We’d like to blame our love of easy outfits on the winter chill, but to be honest, throw-on-and-go is kind of our vibe all year long. But just because it’s quick to slip on doesn’t mean it has to be sweats. This <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">denim jumpsuit</a> is the perfect one-and-done outfit no matter the temperature, and since it’s a neutral base, you can always spice it up with accessories and footwear.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Silver Ballet Pumps</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mint-Velvet-Silver-Ballet-Pumps.jpg><p>If you’re wondering whether it’s too late to hop on the ballet flats bandwagon, it’s not. The shoe style was all over the Spring 2024 runways along with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>metallic footwear</a>, which means this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">silver square-toe option</a> is a great way to nail two trends at once.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.3448275862069><h2>Cream Pleated Shirt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mint-Velvet-Cream-Pleated-Shirt.jpg><p>If you invest in one Mint Velvet item this season, make it this <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>pleated shirt</a>. The design is so unique and interesting, yet somehow versatile at the same time. You can get away with wearing it to the office, date night dinners, special events, and whatever else you have on your schedule.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.44005847953216><h2>Cream Loose Knit Jumper</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mint-Velvet-Cream-Loose-Knit-Jumper.jpeg><p>It is a sweater? A crisp white shirt? Actually, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>this design</a> appears to be both, and between the unexpected mix of materials and sweet bow details on the sleeves, it’s bound to earn you a ton of compliments and questions about where you got it.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Khaki Jacquard Wide Trousers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Khaki-Jacquard-Wide-Trousers.jpg><p>Some days, it feels especially hard to peel off our pajamas and pull on stiff jeans. That’s why we were immediately drawn to these <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">printed trousers</a> and its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">matching top</a>: they’re as soft and cozy as sweats, but look a lot more elevated.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.84713375796178><h2>Green Ruffle Maxi Dress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Green-Ruffle-Maxi-Dress.jpg><p>When it comes to transitional pieces, this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">long ruffled dress</a> reigns supreme. During the colder months, you can style it with tights and boots, but once it warms up a bit, it’ll pair nicely with sneakers or sandals.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.44497607655502><h2>White Utility Jumper</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/White-Utility-Jumper.jpg><p>Although your drawers might be packed with sweaters, you should probably make room for one more. The utility strap details on this <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>ribbed white design</a> make it stand out from the pack, and it’s the perfect neutral layer to balance out the colorful floral skirts or striped shorts we tend to reach for during the warmer months.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratforavwIyvnKWulal6tLzRoqWgZZOhvLW0yKeeaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./juliana-custodio-witness-the-90-day-fiance-stars-hottest-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Juliana Custodio: Witness the 90 Day Fiance Star's Hottest Photos!</span></a>
