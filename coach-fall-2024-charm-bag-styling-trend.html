Why don’t you have every room done up in every color green? Why don’t you order Schiaparelli’s cellophane belt with your name and telephone number on it? In our new series “Why Don’t You,” we’ll pose our own modern-day dares, inspired by our favorite Fashion Week moments. Here, senior fashion editor Tara Gonzalez asks: Why don’t you treat your bag like a charm bracelet?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">Last season I was enamored with the overstuffed jumble spilling out of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-week/a45439377/miu-miu-spring-2024-stuffed-bags/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="big bags at Miu Miu" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>big bags at Miu Miu</u></a>. It felt like Mrs. Prada was giving us permission to live truthfully: to find the beauty in a change of clothes hanging over a bag, instead of trying to conceal it behind a zipped compartment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At Coach this past week, Stuart Vevers explored a similar concept. Except at his Fall/Winter 2024 show, the models weren’t carrying overstuffed bags—the overstuffed bags were carrying bags. Very meta!</p><img alt="coach fall winter 2024" title="coach fall winter 2024" width=3001 height=4500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/coach-bag-details-65ce562421ff1.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kevin Tachman</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Big Coach bags had smaller Coach bags hanging from them, along with New York–themed keychains in the shapes of pretzels, apples, and taxicab. Some even had “I ❤️ New York” mugs dangling, alongside Yankees caps and touristy postcards with handwriting scribbled on the back. After all, the delicate dance of holding onto many bags at once—all of which are tangled in your headphone wires, and possibly sticky from the subway—is a New Yorker calling card. Showing up to dinner with friends while apologizing for the frenzied clutter of stuff you brought with you is a rite of passage. It is more New York than an “I ❤️ New York” souvenir.</p><img alt="model on the runway at coach rtw fall 2024 as part of new york ready to wear fashion week held at the james b duke house on february 12, 2024 in new york, new york photo by giovanni giannoniwwd via getty images" title="Coach RTW Fall 2024 - Runway" width=3406 height=5106 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1998836555-65ce567f9122b.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Giovanni Giannoni</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This collection, Vevers said in the show notes, was “inspired by the city as a setting for love stories old and new, the tension between the romantic and picturesque and the real and the spontaneous that is unique here.” And the indescribable fevered energy of the city, the kind that makes for the off-the-cuff moments for which it is famous, felt best represented in this bag styling.</p><img alt="backstage at coach rtw fall 2024 as part of new york ready to wear fashion week held at the james b duke house on february 12, 2024 in new york, new york photo by nina westerveltwwd via getty images" title="Coach RTW Fall 2024 - Backstage" width=2804 height=4200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/coach-bags-2-65ce56bfbd1ce.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Nina Westervelt</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Treating purses like charm bracelets—wrapping them with pearl necklaces and ribbons and impossibly cute stuffed animal keychains—has become a way to identify Zoomers in the wild. Ironically, the trend was inspired by the way non-Zoomer Jane Birkin made her Birkin bag feel alive with the mementos of her everyday life. But at a time when the internet can make fashion feel depressingly formulaic and homogenous, quirky styling that exudes real personality was bound to catch on.</p><img alt="backstage at coach rtw fall 2024 as part of new york ready to wear fashion week held at the james b duke house on february 12, 2024 in new york, new york photo by nina westerveltwwd via getty images" title="Coach RTW Fall 2024 - Backstage" width=2804 height=4200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1998835626-65ce56d7b67bb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Nina Westervelt</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Coach has consistently been the kind of brand that understands what the kids want, so it feels only right that Vevers would tap into this bag-as-charm-bracelet aesthetic. It is also how plenty of young people already wear his bags.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was influenced to buy a fluffy Coach teddy-bear charm after seeing two friends attach them to their Coach bags two seasons ago, and I wear mine all the time. But now I’m tempted to add another fun knickknack or two alongside it, to mimic the true chaotic energy of New York. It’s the kind of clutter I won’t ever apologize for.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Coach Fall Winter 2024</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="coach fall winter 2024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/coach-fall-2024-look-01-65ce384ad87aa.jpg title="coach fall winter 2024" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
