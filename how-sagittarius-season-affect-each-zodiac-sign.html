Here’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how Sagittarius season 2023 will affect the zodiac signs</a>, since this astrological period encourages new opportunities to grow, evolve, and explore. Once the sun enters this chaptic and exciting mutable fire sign, you may feel increasingly restless while bracing for the next chapter of your cosmic journey.&nbsp;</p><p>The switch <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>from Scorpio season</a> to Sagittarius season will be palpable since it will feel like we’re finally emerging from the underworld. As the sun enters Sagittarius on November 22 at 9:02 a.m. ET, this may bring forth a last-minute burst of enthusiasm before winter begins. Once Sagittarius season begins, the solar luminary will answer to Jupiter, Sagittarius’ ruling planet. Luckily, the Jupiterian undertone will feel auspicious since Jupiter’s energy can amplify a good-natured attitude and serendipitous outlook.</p><p>A day later, there might be some initial tension regarding responsibilities and hierarchies when the sun in Sagittarius <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">squares Saturn in Pisces</a> on November 23. As the square simmers, you may notice that some of your connections are not as easygoing. Coworkers may resist taking on their fair share of work, or loved ones could try to pull a power move. The best way to handle this transit is by knowing when to pick and choose your battles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-27-1.png><p>Shortly after, a six-month cycle will conclude <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">during the full moon in Gemini</a> on November 27, which will occur at 4 degrees. The communicative lunation may refer to a significant change in conversation, writing, and research from the past six months. Some may feel more certain in their educational journey, while others may notice a monumental improvement in their communication-based work. Since Gemini is the sign of the twins, there might even be a call to choose one path over the other after considering all the choices.&nbsp;</p><p>Fated relationships and commitments will come into focus when Venus in Libra <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">opposes the North Node in Aries</a> and conjuncts <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the South Node in Libra</a> on November 29. As Venus sits in between the Nodes of destiny, there might be a call to recognize any patterns or habits that no longer serve you. Codependency, lack of reciprocity, and over-compromising will have to be addressed to ensure a healthier, happier commitment.&nbsp;</p><p>A serious tone will emerge in conversation once Mercury enters Capricorn and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>pre-retrograde shadow period</a> on December 1. Once the cosmic messenger is in a Saturn-ruled sign, there might be more structured and professional discussions. Mercury in Capricorn won’t be very childlike or humorous, so expect to get down to business during this transit. Since Mercury will also be in the pre-shadow phase, you may want to watch your tone, turf, and timing to avoid future problems during Mercury retrograde which will begin later in December.&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>Sagittarius season begins on November 22 at 9:02 a.m. ET and ends on December 21 at 10:27 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>Unfortunately, Venus will lose its dignified state when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the planet of love, money, and beauty</a> enters Scorpio on December 4. Although traditional astrology declares Venus in Scorpio as ill-resourced, this transit can still have empowering capabilities and talents. Resourcefulness will be the key trait of Venus in Scorpio for procuring financially and romantically advantageous opportunities. However, you may have to be mindful of becoming obsessive since Venus in Scorpio can lead to falling down a rabbit hole in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, Venus in Scorpio will form a responsible trine with Saturn in Pisces on December 5, so this harmonious aspect could help deter any potential pitfalls with financial arrangements, romantic possibilities, and style choices.&nbsp;</p><p>Another retrograde concludes on December 6 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when Neptune stations direct in Pisces</a>, which will occur at 24 degrees. Since June 30, 2023, Neptune retrograde has encouraged us to take the rose-colored glasses off. The last few months could have been eye-opening, especially if any illusions or confusion had been dispelled. As Neptune stations direct, a foggy sense of wonder may return. So, it will be up to you to hold yourself accountable for any delusion that may come with direct Neptune!</p><p>It might be time to manage your expectations when Venus in Scorpio opposes Jupiter retrograde in Taurus on December 9. Instead of going into something with foolhardy bolster, the opposition will encourage us to curtail our excitement. This isn’t to say that you cannot be over the moon about a new prospect, but it is to say that you may need to be somewhat realistic as you move forward.</p><p>A new six-month cycle will begin on December 12 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with the new moon in Sagittarius</a>,&nbsp; which will occur at 20 degrees. Since this is the last new moon of the year, this might be the perfect time to set intentions for what you want to bring into 2024. Since Sagittarius is associated with travel, education, and spirituality, new experiences related to such themes will pop up over the next six months. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-28-1.png><p>The final retrograde of 2023 will begin on December 13 when Mercury stations retrograde in Capricorn, which will occur at 8 degrees. Miscommunication, travel issues, and technological problems will undoubtedly happen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">during Mercury retrograde</a>. Since Capricorn is associated with structure, authority, and work, there might be additional issues relating to these attributes. There might be more ego clashes and power struggles that could disrupt a delicate ecosystem during Mercury retrograde in Capricorn. When in doubt, know when to lean out of a nonsensical discussion if someone really wants to go on a powertrip.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever you put your mind to could lead to something wonderful when the sun in Sagittarius trines the North Node in Aries and sextiles the South Node in Libra on December 15. The action-oriented energy suggests that you could feel exceptionally self-assured with pursuing a new fated opportunity or chapter. Deciding to go after this once-in-a-lifetime venture might be easy, even if you are typically more of a people pleaser.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the fated aspects just occurred, you may have to clarify how you want to get from Point A to Point B when the sun in Sagittarius forms a disorienting square <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with Neptune in Pisces</a> on December 16. The square suggests that something has been muddied, so you may need to iron out the details to avoid feeling lost about what you should expect from this new venture.&nbsp;</p><p>After enjoying the breathtaking journey of Sagittarius season, we’ll reach our destination when the sun leaves fiery Sagittarius for dutiful Capricorn on December 21, 2023, at 10:27 p.m. ET. By the time Capricorn season begins, the exuberant undertone will become more responsible as we prepare for the new year.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-sagittarius-season-2023-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign>How Sagittarius Season 2023 Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from Sagittarius season, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.7859504132231><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>It’s all up from here, Aries!
