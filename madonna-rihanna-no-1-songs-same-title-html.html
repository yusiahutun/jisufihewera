He calmed down while he was working with her.</p><p id=par-3_61>Babyface recalled co-writing “Take a Bow” with Madonna. “It was just a beat and the chords,” he recalled. “From there we collaborated and built it up. I was living in <a href=#>Beverly Hills</a> and I created a little studio in my house, so she came over there to write.” Babyface said it was easier to write “Take a Bow” than he expected.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Rihanna’s song of the same name was inspired by another singer’s personal life</h2><p id=par-4_55>Rihanna also has a song called “Take a Bow” which was co-written by R&B star Ne- Yo.
