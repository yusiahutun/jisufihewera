But the reality star came under new fire after revealing the controversial bottle, however, as many beauty fans were quick to compare the design to the iconic Jean Paul Gautier&nbsp;Classique, which is also made in the form of a woman's body. "Copyright infringement," one follower wrote - tagging in the fashion house's official account, while another said: "Similar to Jean Paul Gaultier bottle and Nicky Minaj, not an original idea here tbh."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9a25a405db07-kim-kardashian-perfume-z.jpg><p id=eVsuLQOoGKct data-wc=10><strong>Fans were quick to notice the similarities between the perfumes</strong></p><p id=efzxYVuWBarN data-wc=63>But Kim has already touched on the apparent likeness between hers and Jean Paul Gaultier's perfumes, in an interview with&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Cosmopolitan</a>.&nbsp;"Sculptures were my inspiration, but I love that bottle," she said. "It's iconic and celebrates the woman’s body, but my inspiration was a statue. I wanted [mine] to be really personal with my exact mold, but I’ve always loved the Gaultier bottles."</p><p id=eC3VcS2FfiQi><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: The facial Kim Kardashian has to stay looking young</a></p><p id=eS8dk1vsnVeO data-wc=80>In a series of nude Instagram snaps showing the design process, in true Kardashian form Kim certainly turned a few heads - though it was close&nbsp;pal <a class=hm-link href=#>Chrissy Teigan</a> who was itching to poke fun at the new launch.&nbsp;"Well I'm going to put out a COMPETING PERFUME from a mold of my giant body and it will hold TWICE as much perfume as your bottle and the people will get MORE perfume," Chrissy, who is pregnant with her second child, tweeted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7495e3a9f31f-kim-kardashian-body-mold-z.jpg><p id=e2g-5paE0NZe data-wc=14><strong>The mum-of-three used a mold of her body to create her new perfume bottle</strong></p><p id=eCevoNNHmsdi data-wc=100>Kim's fans and followers certainly had mixed feelings about the campaign for the perfume, which will launch on April 30. "You beautiful woman you! Looking amazing as ever,&nbsp;showing beauty in a body confident way!" said one fan, while others felt she had gone too far with the revealing photographs. "Ok Kim we get it, your body is great. You can stop now," one posted.&nbsp;Another wondered how true-to-life the snaps were, writing on Twitter:&nbsp;"But where is Kim’s c section scar? I need to know. What is this sorcery?!? Is it just photoshopped out? I’m not handling this well."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/54107108e958-kim-kardashian-beauty-launch-z.jpg><p id=eniURZANQa2h><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Kim Kardashian thanks her fans after perfume success</a></p><p id=eCaRXC-z1f8E data-wc=85>The mum-of-three has previously said she is "so proud" of the perfume, telling Business of Fashion about the inspiration for the scent and its unique bottle. "The next fragrance I have coming out in May, KKW Body, is so amazing. It is a sculpture, basically, of my body," she said. "It's really cool. The scent is so good, I'm so proud of it. It smells to me like what I would think golden smells like, even though that's a colour and something that's just luminous."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKqkoZ6YrrOxjJqlnWWWp66ovsCnmp6rX2d9coSPbWlubGhmfXJ7yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdlkqSxunnFq5igqpGjsKZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./geordie-shores-bethan-kershaw-puts-busty-display-html.html><span>←</span><span>Geordie Shore's Bethan Kershaw puts on a busty display</span></a>
