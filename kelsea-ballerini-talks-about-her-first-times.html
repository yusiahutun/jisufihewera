It gets worse, much worse.</p><p>"I'm not a bad driver ... but that car protected me through six car wrecks," she adds about her first car. It's the kind of car you give a name to, which Ballerini did. It's a name fit for a superstar not afraid to scrap, which it sounds like she did plenty of while driving as a teenager.</p><p>First crush and first job were two others Ballerini openly talked about. She also added that she'd be buying her first album at Walmart. The First Time dropped last week. Her debut single is nearly a Top 10 hit, an impressive feat for a female artist in today's country culture, especially one on an independent record label.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: See the Top 10 Songs of 2015, So Far</a><p><strong>More Artists to Keep an Eye on in 2015</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2cqLKiecGao6Wdop67qnnTmqOkq12Wr7DB02afnqpdm7azv9Nmq6Kllah8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./516583-constructor-shows-fully-tiled-mabati-house-cost-ksh-180k.html><span>←</span><span>Constructor Shows Off Fully Tiled Mabati House, Says It Cost KSh 180k</span></a>
